abstract: 'Background and Objectives: LAMA2-related muscular dystrophy (LAMA2-MD)
  is a rare neuromuscular disease characterized by proximal and axial muscle weakness,
  rigidity of the spine, scoliosis, and respiratory impairment. No curative treatment
  options exist, yet promising preclinical studies are ongoing. Currently, there is
  a paucity on natural history data, and appropriate clinical and functional outcome
  measures are needed. We aim for deep clinical phenotyping, establishment of a well-characterized
  baseline cohort for prospective follow-up and recruitment for future clinical trials,
  improvement of clinical care, and selection of outcome measures for reaching trial
  readiness. Methods: We performed a cross-sectional, single-center, observational
  study. This study included neurologic examination and functional measurements among
  others the Motor Function Measure 20/32 (MFM-20/32) as primary outcome measure,
  accelerometry, questionnaires, muscle ultrasound, respiratory function tests, electrocardiography
  and echocardiography, and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Results: Twenty-seven
  patients with genetically confirmed LAMA2-MD were included (21 $±$ 13 years; M =
  9; ambulant = 7). Axial and proximal muscle weakness was most pronounced. The mean
  MFM-20/32 score was 42.0% $±$ 29.4%, with domain 1 (standing and transfers) being
  severely affected and domain 3 (distal muscle function) relatively spared. Physical
  activity as measured through accelerometry showed very strong correlations to MFM-20/32
  (Pearson correlation, -0.928, p < 0.01). Muscle ultrasound showed symmetrically
  increased echogenicity, with the sternocleidomastoid muscle most affected. Respiratory
  function was impaired in 85% of patients without prominent diaphragm dysfunction
  and was independent of age. Ten patients (37%) needed (non)invasive ventilatory
  support. Cardiac assessment revealed QRS fragmentation in 62%, abnormal left ventricular
  global longitudinal strain in 25%, and decreased left ventricular ejection fraction
  in 14% of patients. Decreased bone quality leading to fragility fractures was seen
  in most of the patients. Discussion: LAMA2-MD has a widely variable phenotype. Based
  on the results of this cross-sectional study and current standards of care for congenital
  muscular dystrophies, we advise routine cardiorespiratory follow-up and optimization
  of bone quality. We propose MFM-20/32, accelerometry, and muscle ultrasound for
  assessing disease severity and progression. For definitive clinical recommendations
  and outcome measures, natural history data are needed. Clinical Trials Registration:
  This study was registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT04478981, 21 July 2020). The
  first patient was enrolled in September 2020.'
