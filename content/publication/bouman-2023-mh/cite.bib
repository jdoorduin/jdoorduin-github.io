 abstract = {Background and Objectives: LAMA2-related muscular dystrophy
(LAMA2-MD) is a rare neuromuscular disease characterized by
proximal and axial muscle weakness, rigidity of the spine,
scoliosis, and respiratory impairment. No curative treatment
options exist, yet promising preclinical studies are ongoing.
Currently, there is a paucity on natural history data, and
appropriate clinical and functional outcome measures are needed.
We aim for deep clinical phenotyping, establishment of a
well-characterized baseline cohort for prospective follow-up and
recruitment for future clinical trials, improvement of clinical
care, and selection of outcome measures for reaching trial
readiness. Methods: We performed a cross-sectional,
single-center, observational study. This study included
neurologic examination and functional measurements among others
the Motor Function Measure 20/32 (MFM-20/32) as primary outcome
measure, accelerometry, questionnaires, muscle ultrasound,
respiratory function tests, electrocardiography and
echocardiography, and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Results:
Twenty-seven patients with genetically confirmed LAMA2-MD were
included (21 $±$ 13 years; M = 9; ambulant = 7). Axial and
proximal muscle weakness was most pronounced. The mean MFM-20/32
score was 42.0% $±$ 29.4%, with domain 1 (standing and
transfers) being severely affected and domain 3 (distal muscle
function) relatively spared. Physical activity as measured
through accelerometry showed very strong correlations to
MFM-20/32 (Pearson correlation, -0.928, p < 0.01). Muscle
ultrasound showed symmetrically increased echogenicity, with the
sternocleidomastoid muscle most affected. Respiratory function
was impaired in 85% of patients without prominent diaphragm
dysfunction and was independent of age. Ten patients (37%)
needed (non)invasive ventilatory support. Cardiac assessment
revealed QRS fragmentation in 62%, abnormal left ventricular
global longitudinal strain in 25%, and decreased left
ventricular ejection fraction in 14% of patients. Decreased bone
quality leading to fragility fractures was seen in most of the
patients. Discussion: LAMA2-MD has a widely variable phenotype.
Based on the results of this cross-sectional study and current
standards of care for congenital muscular dystrophies, we advise
routine cardiorespiratory follow-up and optimization of bone
quality. We propose MFM-20/32, accelerometry, and muscle
ultrasound for assessing disease severity and progression. For
definitive clinical recommendations and outcome measures, natural
history data are needed. Clinical Trials Registration: This study
was registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT04478981, 21 July 2020).
The first patient was enrolled in September 2020.},
