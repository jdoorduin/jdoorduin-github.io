 abstract = {The mechanisms that modulate the kinetics of muscle relaxation
are critically important for muscle function. A prime example of
the impact of impaired relaxation kinetics is nemaline myopathy
caused by mutations in KBTBD13 (NEM6). In addition to weakness,
NEM6 patients have slow muscle relaxation, compromising
contractility and daily life activities. The role of KBTBD13 in
muscle is unknown, and the pathomechanism underlying NEM6 is
undetermined. A combination of transcranial magnetic
stimulation-induced muscle relaxation, muscle fiber- and
sarcomere-contractility assays, low-angle x-ray diffraction, and
superresolution microscopy revealed that the impaired
muscle-relaxation kinetics in NEM6 patients are caused by
structural changes in the thin filament, a sarcomeric
microstructure. Using homology modeling and binding and
contractility assays with recombinant KBTBD13, Kbtbd13-knockout
and Kbtbd13R408C-knockin mouse models, and a GFP-labeled
Kbtbd13-transgenic zebrafish model, we discovered that KBTBD13
binds to actin - a major constituent of the thin filament - and
that mutations in KBTBD13 cause structural changes impairing
muscle-relaxation kinetics. We propose that this actin-based
impaired relaxation is central to NEM6 pathology.},
