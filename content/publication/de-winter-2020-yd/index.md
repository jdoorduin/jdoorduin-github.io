abstract: The mechanisms that modulate the kinetics of muscle relaxation are critically
  important for muscle function. A prime example of the impact of impaired relaxation
  kinetics is nemaline myopathy caused by mutations in KBTBD13 (NEM6). In addition
  to weakness, NEM6 patients have slow muscle relaxation, compromising contractility
  and daily life activities. The role of KBTBD13 in muscle is unknown, and the pathomechanism
  underlying NEM6 is undetermined. A combination of transcranial magnetic stimulation-induced
  muscle relaxation, muscle fiber- and sarcomere-contractility assays, low-angle x-ray
  diffraction, and superresolution microscopy revealed that the impaired muscle-relaxation
  kinetics in NEM6 patients are caused by structural changes in the thin filament,
  a sarcomeric microstructure. Using homology modeling and binding and contractility
  assays with recombinant KBTBD13, Kbtbd13-knockout and Kbtbd13R408C-knockin mouse
  models, and a GFP-labeled Kbtbd13-transgenic zebrafish model, we discovered that
  KBTBD13 binds to actin - a major constituent of the thin filament - and that mutations
  in KBTBD13 cause structural changes impairing muscle-relaxation kinetics. We propose
  that this actin-based impaired relaxation is central to NEM6 pathology.
