 abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The diagnosis of inclusion body myositis (IBM) can
be challenging, and its presentation can be confused with other
forms of myositis or neuromuscular disorders. In this study we
evaluate the ability of quantitative muscle ultrasound to
differentiate between IBM and mimicking diseases. METHODS:
Patients 50 years of age and older were included from two
specialty centers. Muscle echogenicity and muscle thickness of
four characteristically involved muscles in IBM were measured
and compared with polymyositis (PM)/dermatomyositis (DM), other
neuromuscular disorders, and healthy controls. RESULTS:
Echogenicity was higher and muscle thickness generally lower in
all four muscles in IBM compared with PM/DM and normal controls.
When comparing IBM with the comparator groups, the flexor
digitorum profundus was the most discriminative muscle.
DISCUSSION: Ultrasound appears to be a good test to
differentiate established IBM from PM/DM and neuromuscular
controls, with value as a diagnostic tool for IBM.},
