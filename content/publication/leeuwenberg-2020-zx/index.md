abstract: 'INTRODUCTION: The diagnosis of inclusion body myositis (IBM) can be challenging,
  and its presentation can be confused with other forms of myositis or neuromuscular
  disorders. In this study we evaluate the ability of quantitative muscle ultrasound
  to differentiate between IBM and mimicking diseases. METHODS: Patients 50 years
  of age and older were included from two specialty centers. Muscle echogenicity and
  muscle thickness of four characteristically involved muscles in IBM were measured
  and compared with polymyositis (PM)/dermatomyositis (DM), other neuromuscular disorders,
  and healthy controls. RESULTS: Echogenicity was higher and muscle thickness generally
  lower in all four muscles in IBM compared with PM/DM and normal controls. When comparing
  IBM with the comparator groups, the flexor digitorum profundus was the most discriminative
  muscle. DISCUSSION: Ultrasound appears to be a good test to differentiate established
  IBM from PM/DM and neuromuscular controls, with value as a diagnostic tool for IBM.'
