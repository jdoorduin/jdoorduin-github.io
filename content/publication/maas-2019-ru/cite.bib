 abstract = {BACKGROUND: Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) is the most
common subtype among the autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias,
a group of neurodegenerative disorders for which currently no
disease-specific therapy is available. Evidence-based options
for symptomatic treatment of ataxia are also limited. Recent
investigations in a heterogeneous group of hereditary and
acquired ataxias showed promising, prolonged effects of a
two-week course with daily sessions of cerebellar anodal
transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) on ataxia
severity, gait speed, and upper limb dexterity. The aim of the
SCA3-tDCS study is to further examine whether tDCS improves
ataxia severity and various (cerebellar) non-motor symptoms in a
homogeneous cohort of SCA3 patients and to explore the time
course of these effects. METHODS/DESIGN: An
investigator-initiated, double-blind, randomized,
sham-controlled, single-center trial will be conducted. Twenty
mildly to moderately affected SCA3 patients (Scale for the
Assessment and Rating of Ataxia score between 3 and 20) will be
included and randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either
cerebellar anodal tDCS or sham cerebellar tDCS. Patients,
investigators, and outcome assessors are unaware of treatment
allocation. Cerebellar tDCS (20 min, 2 mA, ramp-up and down
periods of 30 s each) will be delivered over ten sessions,
distributed in two groups of five consecutive days with a
two-day break in between. Outcomes are assessed after a single
session of tDCS, after the tenth stimulation (T1), and after
three, six, and twelve months. The primary outcome measure is
the absolute change of the SARA score between baseline and T1.
In addition, effects on a variety of other motor and
neuropsychological functions in which the cerebellum is known to
be involved will be evaluated using quantitative motor tests,
static posturography, neurophysiological measurements, cognitive
assessment, and questionnaires. DISCUSSION: The results of this
study will inform us whether repeated sessions of cerebellar
anodal tDCS benefit SCA3 patients and whether this form of
non-invasive stimulation might be a novel therapeutic approach
to consider in a neurorehabilitation setting. Combined with two
earlier controlled trials, a positive effect of the SCA3-tDCS
study will encourage implementation of this intervention and
stimulate further research in other SCAs and heredodegenerative
ataxias. TRIAL REGISTRATION: NL7321 , registered October 8,
