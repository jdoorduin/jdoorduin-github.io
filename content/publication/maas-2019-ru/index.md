abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) is the most common subtype
  among the autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias, a group of neurodegenerative disorders
  for which currently no disease-specific therapy is available. Evidence-based options
  for symptomatic treatment of ataxia are also limited. Recent investigations in a
  heterogeneous group of hereditary and acquired ataxias showed promising, prolonged
  effects of a two-week course with daily sessions of cerebellar anodal transcranial
  direct current stimulation (tDCS) on ataxia severity, gait speed, and upper limb
  dexterity. The aim of the SCA3-tDCS study is to further examine whether tDCS improves
  ataxia severity and various (cerebellar) non-motor symptoms in a homogeneous cohort
  of SCA3 patients and to explore the time course of these effects. METHODS/DESIGN:
  An investigator-initiated, double-blind, randomized, sham-controlled, single-center
  trial will be conducted. Twenty mildly to moderately affected SCA3 patients (Scale
  for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia score between 3 and 20) will be included
  and randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either cerebellar anodal tDCS or sham cerebellar
  tDCS. Patients, investigators, and outcome assessors are unaware of treatment allocation.
  Cerebellar tDCS (20 min, 2 mA, ramp-up and down periods of 30 s each) will be delivered
  over ten sessions, distributed in two groups of five consecutive days with a two-day
  break in between. Outcomes are assessed after a single session of tDCS, after the
  tenth stimulation (T1), and after three, six, and twelve months. The primary outcome
  measure is the absolute change of the SARA score between baseline and T1. In addition,
  effects on a variety of other motor and neuropsychological functions in which the
  cerebellum is known to be involved will be evaluated using quantitative motor tests,
  static posturography, neurophysiological measurements, cognitive assessment, and
  questionnaires. DISCUSSION: The results of this study will inform us whether repeated
  sessions of cerebellar anodal tDCS benefit SCA3 patients and whether this form of
  non-invasive stimulation might be a novel therapeutic approach to consider in a
  neurorehabilitation setting. Combined with two earlier controlled trials, a positive
  effect of the SCA3-tDCS study will encourage implementation of this intervention
  and stimulate further research in other SCAs and heredodegenerative ataxias. TRIAL
