 abstract = {RATIONALE: Acquired diaphragm muscle weakness is a key feature
in several chronic conditions, including chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease, congestive heart failure, and difficult
weaning from mechanical ventilation. No drugs are available to
improve respiratory muscle function in these patients. Recently,
we have shown that the calcium sensitizer levosimendan enhances
the force-generating capacity of isolated diaphragm fibers.
OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effects of the calcium sensitizer
levosimendan on in vivo human diaphragm function. METHODS: In a
double-blind, randomized, crossover design, 30 healthy subjects
performed two identical inspiratory loading tasks. After the
first loading task, subjects received levosimendan (40 $μ$g/kg
bolus followed by 0.1/0.2 $μ$g/kg/min continuous infusion) or
placebo. Transdiaphragmatic pressure, diaphragm electrical
activity, and their relationship (neuromechanical efficiency)
were measured during loading. Magnetic phrenic nerve stimulation
was performed before the first loading task and after bolus
administration to assess twitch contractility. Center frequency
of diaphragm electrical activity was evaluated to study the
effects of levosimendan on muscle fiber conduction velocity.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The placebo group showed a 9%
(P=0.01) loss of twitch contractility after loaded breathing,
whereas no loss in contractility was observed in the
levosimendan group. Neuro-mechanical efficiency of the diaphragm
during loading improved by 21% (P<0.05) in the levosimendan
group. Baseline center frequency of diaphragm electrical
activity was reduced after levosimendan administration (P<0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: The calcium sensitizer levosimendan improves
neuromechanical efficiency and contractile function of the human
diaphragm. Our findings suggest a new therapeutic approach to
improve respiratory muscle function in patients with respiratory
failure.},
