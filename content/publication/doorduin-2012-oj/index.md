abstract: 'RATIONALE: Acquired diaphragm muscle weakness is a key feature in several
  chronic conditions, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, congestive
  heart failure, and difficult weaning from mechanical ventilation. No drugs are available
  to improve respiratory muscle function in these patients. Recently, we have shown
  that the calcium sensitizer levosimendan enhances the force-generating capacity
  of isolated diaphragm fibers. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effects of the calcium
  sensitizer levosimendan on in vivo human diaphragm function. METHODS: In a double-blind,
  randomized, crossover design, 30 healthy subjects performed two identical inspiratory
  loading tasks. After the first loading task, subjects received levosimendan (40
  $μ$g/kg bolus followed by 0.1/0.2 $μ$g/kg/min continuous infusion) or placebo. Transdiaphragmatic
  pressure, diaphragm electrical activity, and their relationship (neuromechanical
  efficiency) were measured during loading. Magnetic phrenic nerve stimulation was
  performed before the first loading task and after bolus administration to assess
  twitch contractility. Center frequency of diaphragm electrical activity was evaluated
  to study the effects of levosimendan on muscle fiber conduction velocity. MEASUREMENTS
  AND MAIN RESULTS: The placebo group showed a 9% (P=0.01) loss of twitch contractility
  after loaded breathing, whereas no loss in contractility was observed in the levosimendan
  group. Neuro-mechanical efficiency of the diaphragm during loading improved by 21%
  (P<0.05) in the levosimendan group. Baseline center frequency of diaphragm electrical
  activity was reduced after levosimendan administration (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The
  calcium sensitizer levosimendan improves neuromechanical efficiency and contractile
  function of the human diaphragm. Our findings suggest a new therapeutic approach
  to improve respiratory muscle function in patients with respiratory failure.'
