abstract: 'INTRODUCTION: LAMA2-related muscular dystrophy (LAMA2-MD) and SELENON(SEPN1)-related
  congenital myopathy (SELENON-RM) are rare neuromuscular diseases with respiratory
  impairment from a young age. Prospective natural history studies are needed for
  prevalence estimations, respiratory characterization, optimizing clinical care and
  selecting outcome measures for trial readiness. METHODS: Our prospective 1.5-year
  natural history study included spirometry (forced vital capacity (FVC); difference
  between upright and supine vital capacity (dVC)), respiratory muscle strength tests
  (sniff nasal inspiratory pressure (SNIP)) (age$â‰¥$5 years), and diaphragm ultrasound
  (thickness; thickening; echogenicity; all ages). RESULTS: Twenty-six LAMA2-MD patients
  (M = 8, median 21 [9; 31] years) and 11 SELENON-RM patients (M = 8, 20 [10; 33]
  years) were included. At baseline, 17 (85 %) LAMA2-MD (FVC%: 59 % [33; 68]) and
  all SELENON-RM patients (FVC%: 34 % [31; 46]) had an impaired respiratory function
  (FVC%<80 %). Nine (35 %) LAMA2-MD and eight (73 %) SELENON-RM patients received
  mechanical ventilation at baseline, and two additional SELENON-RM patients started
  during follow-up. Contrarily to LAMA2-MD, SELENON-RM patients had severe diaphragm
  atrophy (diaphragm thickness z-score: 2.5 [-3.1; -2.1]) and dysfunction (diaphragm
  thickness ratio: 1.2 [1.0; 1.7]; dVC: 30 % [7.7; 41]). SNIP was low in both neuromuscular
  diseases and correlated with motor function. In SELENON-RM, respiratory function
  decreased during follow-up. CONCLUSION: The majority of LAMA2-MD and all SELENON-RM
  patients had respiratory impairment. SELENON-RM patients showed lower respiratory
  function which was progressive, more prevalent mechanical ventilation, and more
  severe diaphragm atrophy and dysfunction than LAMA2-MD patients. Spirometry (FVC%,
  dVC) and respiratory muscle strength tests (SNIP) are useful in clinical care and
  as outcome measure in clinical trials. CLINICAL TRIAL NUMBER: NCT04478981.'
