abstract: 'INTRODUCTION/AIMS: Diaphragm ultrasound is increasingly used in the diagnosis
  of diaphragm dysfunction and to guide respiratory management in patients with neuromuscular
  disorders and those who are critically ill. However, the association between diaphragm
  ultrasound variables and demographic factors like age, sex, and body mass index
  (BMI) are understudied. Such relationships are important for correct interpretation
  of normative values and comparison with selected patients groups. The aim of this
  study was to determine the associations between diaphragm ultrasound variables and
  subject characteristics. METHODS: B-mode ultrasound was used to image the diaphragm
  at the zone of apposition in 83 healthy subjects. Diaphragm thickness at resting
  end-expiration (Tend-exp ), diaphragm thickness at maximal end-inspiration (Tmax-insp
  ), diaphragm thickening ratio (Tmax-insp /Tend-exp ), and diaphragm echogenicity
  were measured. Multivariate linear regression was used to explore the associations
  between diaphragm ultrasound variables and subject characteristics. RESULTS: Tend-exp
  , Tmax-insp , and thickening ratio do not change with age whereas diaphragm echogenicity
  increases with age. The thickening ratio had a weak negative association with BMI,
  while Tend-exp was positively associated with BMI. Men had a larger Tend-exp and
  Tmax-insp than women (Tend-exp 1.6 $±$ 0.5 and 1.4 $±$ 0.3 mm; p = .011, Tmax-insp
  3.8 $±$ 1.0 and 3.2 $±$ 0.9 mm; p = .004), but similar thickening ratios. DISCUSSION:
  Diaphragm thickness, thickening, and echogenicity measured with ultrasound are associated
  with factors such as age, BMI, and sex. Therefore, subject characteristics should
  be considered when interpreting diaphragm ultrasound measurements. In the absence
  of normative values, matched control groups are a prerequisite for research and
  in clinical practice.'
