 abstract = {INTRODUCTION/AIMS: Diaphragm ultrasound is increasingly used in
the diagnosis of diaphragm dysfunction and to guide respiratory
management in patients with neuromuscular disorders and those
who are critically ill. However, the association between
diaphragm ultrasound variables and demographic factors like age,
sex, and body mass index (BMI) are understudied. Such
relationships are important for correct interpretation of
normative values and comparison with selected patients groups.
The aim of this study was to determine the associations between
diaphragm ultrasound variables and subject characteristics.
METHODS: B-mode ultrasound was used to image the diaphragm at
the zone of apposition in 83 healthy subjects. Diaphragm
thickness at resting end-expiration (Tend-exp ), diaphragm
thickness at maximal end-inspiration (Tmax-insp ), diaphragm
thickening ratio (Tmax-insp /Tend-exp ), and diaphragm
echogenicity were measured. Multivariate linear regression was
used to explore the associations between diaphragm ultrasound
variables and subject characteristics. RESULTS: Tend-exp ,
Tmax-insp , and thickening ratio do not change with age whereas
diaphragm echogenicity increases with age. The thickening ratio
had a weak negative association with BMI, while Tend-exp was
positively associated with BMI. Men had a larger Tend-exp and
Tmax-insp than women (Tend-exp 1.6 $±$ 0.5 and 1.4 $±$ 0.3
mm; p = .011, Tmax-insp 3.8 $±$ 1.0 and 3.2 $±$ 0.9 mm; p =
.004), but similar thickening ratios. DISCUSSION: Diaphragm
thickness, thickening, and echogenicity measured with ultrasound
are associated with factors such as age, BMI, and sex.
Therefore, subject characteristics should be considered when
interpreting diaphragm ultrasound measurements. In the absence
of normative values, matched control groups are a prerequisite
for research and in clinical practice.},
