 abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Controversy persists as to whether the lung
interposes on the needle electrode insertion path during
diaphragm electromyography (EMG). METHODS: Using high-resolution
ultrasonography, we measured the distances between the medial
recess of the intercostal spaces (ICSs) around the mid-clavicular
line (MCL) and the lung margin. We performed measurements
bilaterally during quiet breathing in the seated and supine
positions. RESULTS: We studied 10 young healthy men and found
that, in the first ICS with the medial recess clearly (i.e.,
several cm) lateral to MCL (usually the eighth ICS), the distance
between the recommended insertion site and the lung margin varied
from 7.5 to 17 cm. The distance was slightly larger on the right
side and in the supine position. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms
that properly conducted ``trans-intercostal'' needle EMG of the
diaphragm is generally safe in healthy subjects. Muscle Nerve 54:
