abstract: "INTRODUCTION: Controversy persists as to whether the lung interposes on
  the needle electrode insertion path during diaphragm electromyography (EMG). METHODS:
  Using high-resolution ultrasonography, we measured the distances between the medial
  recess of the intercostal spaces (ICSs) around the mid-clavicular line (MCL) and
  the lung margin. We performed measurements bilaterally during quiet breathing in
  the seated and supine positions. RESULTS: We studied 10 young healthy men and found
  that, in the first ICS with the medial recess clearly (i.e., several cm) lateral
  to MCL (usually the eighth ICS), the distance between the recommended insertion
  site and the lung margin varied from 7.5 to 17 cm. The distance was slightly larger
  on the right side and in the supine position. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms that
  properly conducted ``trans-intercostal'' needle EMG of the diaphragm is generally
  safe in healthy subjects. Muscle Nerve 54: 54-57, 2016."
