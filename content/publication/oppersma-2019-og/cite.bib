 abstract = {BACKGROUND: Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) provides ventilatory
support for patients with respiratory failure. However, the
glottis can act as a closing valve, limiting effectiveness of
NIV. This study investigates the patency of the glottis during
NIV in patients with acute exacerbation of Chronic Obstructive
Pulmonary Disease (COPD). METHODS: Electrical activity of the
diaphragm, flow, pressure and videolaryngoscopy were acquired.
NIV was randomly applied in pressure support (PSV) and neurally
adjusted ventilatory assist (NAVA) mode with two levels of
support. The angle formed by the vocal cords represented glottis
patency. RESULTS: Eight COPD patients with acute exacerbation
requiring NIV were included. No differences were found in median
glottis angle during inspiration or peak inspiratory effort
between PSV and NAVA at low and high support levels. CONCLUSIONS:
The present study showed that glottis patency during inspiration
in patients with an acute exacerbation of COPD is not affected by
mode (PSV or NAVA) or level of assist (5 or 15 cm H2O) during
NIV.},
