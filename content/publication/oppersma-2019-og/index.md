abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) provides ventilatory support
  for patients with respiratory failure. However, the glottis can act as a closing
  valve, limiting effectiveness of NIV. This study investigates the patency of the
  glottis during NIV in patients with acute exacerbation of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary
  Disease (COPD). METHODS: Electrical activity of the diaphragm, flow, pressure and
  videolaryngoscopy were acquired. NIV was randomly applied in pressure support (PSV)
  and neurally adjusted ventilatory assist (NAVA) mode with two levels of support.
  The angle formed by the vocal cords represented glottis patency. RESULTS: Eight
  COPD patients with acute exacerbation requiring NIV were included. No differences
  were found in median glottis angle during inspiration or peak inspiratory effort
  between PSV and NAVA at low and high support levels. CONCLUSIONS: The present study
  showed that glottis patency during inspiration in patients with an acute exacerbation
  of COPD is not affected by mode (PSV or NAVA) or level of assist (5 or 15 cm H2O)
  during NIV.'
