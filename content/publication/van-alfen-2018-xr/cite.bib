 abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical phenotype and recovery of
diaphragm dysfunction caused by neuralgic amyotrophy in a large
cohort of patients, to improve accurate awareness of this entity,
and to encourage adoption of a standardized approach for
diagnosis and treatment. METHODS: This observational cohort study
recruited adult patients with neuralgic amyotrophy and symptoms
of idiopathic phrenic neuropathy from the database of the Dutch
expert center for neuralgic amyotrophy and the Dutch centers for
home mechanical ventilation. Demographic and clinical information
on diagnosis, symptoms, and recovery was obtained from chart
review. We attempted to contact all patients for a follow-up
interview. RESULTS: Phrenic neuropathy occurs in 7.6% of
patients with neuralgic amyotrophy. Unilateral diaphragmatic
dysfunction and bilateral diaphragmatic dysfunction are
frequently symptomatic, causing exertional dyspnea, orthopnea,
disturbed sleep, and excessive fatigue. Diagnostic practices
varied widely and were often not optimally targeted. The majority
of patients experienced at least moderate recovery within 2
years. CONCLUSION: We recommend screening every patient with
neuralgic amyotrophy for diaphragm dysfunction by asking about
orthopnea and by performing upright and supine vital capacity
screening and diaphragm ultrasound in cases of suspected phrenic
neuropathy to optimize diagnosis and care.},
