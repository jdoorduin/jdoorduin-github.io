abstract: 'OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical phenotype and recovery of diaphragm
  dysfunction caused by neuralgic amyotrophy in a large cohort of patients, to improve
  accurate awareness of this entity, and to encourage adoption of a standardized approach
  for diagnosis and treatment. METHODS: This observational cohort study recruited
  adult patients with neuralgic amyotrophy and symptoms of idiopathic phrenic neuropathy
  from the database of the Dutch expert center for neuralgic amyotrophy and the Dutch
  centers for home mechanical ventilation. Demographic and clinical information on
  diagnosis, symptoms, and recovery was obtained from chart review. We attempted to
  contact all patients for a follow-up interview. RESULTS: Phrenic neuropathy occurs
  in 7.6% of patients with neuralgic amyotrophy. Unilateral diaphragmatic dysfunction
  and bilateral diaphragmatic dysfunction are frequently symptomatic, causing exertional
  dyspnea, orthopnea, disturbed sleep, and excessive fatigue. Diagnostic practices
  varied widely and were often not optimally targeted. The majority of patients experienced
  at least moderate recovery within 2 years. CONCLUSION: We recommend screening every
  patient with neuralgic amyotrophy for diaphragm dysfunction by asking about orthopnea
  and by performing upright and supine vital capacity screening and diaphragm ultrasound
  in cases of suspected phrenic neuropathy to optimize diagnosis and care.'
