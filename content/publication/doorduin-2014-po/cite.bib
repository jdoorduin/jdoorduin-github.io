 abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Delivering synchronous assist during non-invasive
ventilation (NIV) is challenging with flow- or
pressure-controlled ventilators, especially in patients with
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Neurally adjusted
ventilatory assist (NAVA) uses diaphragm electrical activity
(EAdi) to control the ventilator. We evaluated
patient-ventilator interaction in patients with COPD during NIV
with pressure support ventilation (PSV) and NAVA using a
recently introduced automated analysis. METHODS: Twelve COPD
patients underwent three 30-minute trials: 1) PSV with dedicated
NIV ventilator (NIV-PSVVision), 2) PSV with intensive care unit
(ICU) ventilator (NIV-PSVServo-I), and 3) with NIV-NAVA. EAdi,
flow, and airway pressure were recorded. Patient-ventilator
interaction was evaluated by comparing airway pressure and EAdi
waveforms with automated computer algorithms. The NeuroSync
index was calculated as the percentage of timing errors between
airway pressure and EAdi. RESULTS: The NeuroSync index was
higher (larger error) for NIV-PSVVision (24 (IQR 15 to 30) %)
and NIV-PSVServo-I (21 (IQR 15 to 26) %) compared to NIV-NAVA
(5 (IQR 4 to 7) %; P <0.001). Wasted efforts, trigger delays
and cycling-off errors were less with NAVA (P <0.05 for all).
The NeuroSync index and the number of wasted efforts were
strongly correlated (r2 = 0.84), with a drastic increase in
wasted efforts after timing errors reach 20%. CONCLUSIONS: In
COPD patients, non-invasive NAVA improves patient-ventilator
interaction compared to PSV, delivered either by a dedicated or
ICU ventilator. The automated analysis of patient-ventilator
interaction allowed for an objective detection of
patient-ventilator interaction during NIV. In addition, we found
that progressive mismatch between neural effort and pneumatic
timing is associated with wasted efforts.},
