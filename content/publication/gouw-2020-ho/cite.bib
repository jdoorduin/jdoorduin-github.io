 abstract = {BACKGROUND: Studies have shown co-contraction of jaw and neck
muscles in healthy subjects during (sub) maximum voluntary jaw
clenching, indicating functional inter-relation between these
muscles during awake bruxism. So far, coherence of jaw and neck
muscles has not been evaluated during either awake or sleep
bruxism. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate
the coherence between jaw and neck muscle activity during sleep
bruxism. METHODS: In a cross-sectional observational design, the
electromyographic activity of jaw (masseter, temporalis) and
neck (sternocleidomastoid, trapezius) muscles in individuals
with ``definite'' sleep bruxism was measured using ambulatory
polysomnography (PSG). Coherence for masseter-temporalis,
masseter-sternocleidomastoid and masseter-trapezius was measured
during phasic and mixed rhythmic masticatory muscle activity
episodes using coherence-analysing software. Outcome measures
were as follows: presence or absence of significant coherence
per episode (in percentages), frequency of peak coherence (FPC)
per episode and sleep stage. RESULTS: A total of 632 episodes
within 16 PSGs of eight individuals were analysed. Significant
coherence was found between the jaw and neck muscles in 84.9%
of the episodes. FPCs of masseter-temporalis were significantly
positively correlated with those of masseter-sternocleidomastoid
or masseter-trapezius (P < .001). Sleep stages did not
significantly influence coherence of these muscular couples.
CONCLUSION: During sleep bruxism, jaw and neck muscle activation
is significantly coherent. Coherence occurs independently of
sleep stage. These results support the hypothesis of bruxism
being a centrally regulated phenomenon.},
