abstract: "BACKGROUND: Studies have shown co-contraction of jaw and neck muscles in
  healthy subjects during (sub) maximum voluntary jaw clenching, indicating functional
  inter-relation between these muscles during awake bruxism. So far, coherence of
  jaw and neck muscles has not been evaluated during either awake or sleep bruxism.
  OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate the coherence between jaw
  and neck muscle activity during sleep bruxism. METHODS: In a cross-sectional observational
  design, the electromyographic activity of jaw (masseter, temporalis) and neck (sternocleidomastoid,
  trapezius) muscles in individuals with ``definite'' sleep bruxism was measured using
  ambulatory polysomnography (PSG). Coherence for masseter-temporalis, masseter-sternocleidomastoid
  and masseter-trapezius was measured during phasic and mixed rhythmic masticatory
  muscle activity episodes using coherence-analysing software. Outcome measures were
  as follows: presence or absence of significant coherence per episode (in percentages),
  frequency of peak coherence (FPC) per episode and sleep stage. RESULTS: A total
  of 632 episodes within 16 PSGs of eight individuals were analysed. Significant coherence
  was found between the jaw and neck muscles in 84.9% of the episodes. FPCs of masseter-temporalis
  were significantly positively correlated with those of masseter-sternocleidomastoid
  or masseter-trapezius (P < .001). Sleep stages did not significantly influence coherence
  of these muscular couples. CONCLUSION: During sleep bruxism, jaw and neck muscle
  activation is significantly coherent. Coherence occurs independently of sleep stage.
  These results support the hypothesis of bruxism being a centrally regulated phenomenon."
