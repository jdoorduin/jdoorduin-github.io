 abstract = {In this cross-sectional study, we comprehensively assessed
respiratory muscle function in various clinical forms of
nemaline myopathy (NM) including non-volitional tests for
diaphragm function. Forty-two patients with NM were included (10
males (25-74 y/o); 32 females (11-76 y/o)). The NM forms were
typical (n=11), mild (n=7), or childhood-onset with slowness of
movements (n=24). Forced vital capacity (FVC) and maximal
inspiratory pressure were decreased in typical NM in comparison
with childhood-onset NM with slowness (32.0 [29.0-58.5] vs 81.0
[75.0-87.0]%, p<0.01, and 35.0 [24.0-55.0] vs 81.0 [65.0-102.5]
cmH2O, p<0.01). Eight patients with childhood-onset NM with
slowness had respiratory muscle weakness. There was a low
correlation between FVC and Motor Function Measure scores
(r=0.48, p<0.01). End-inspiratory diaphragm thickness and twitch
mouth pressure were decreased in patients requiring home
mechanical ventilation compared to non-ventilated patients with
normal lung function (1.8 [1.5-2.4] vs 3.1 [2.0-4.6] mm,
p=0.049, and -7.9 [-10.9- -4.0] vs -14.9 [-17.3- -12.6],
p=0.04). Our results show that respiratory muscle weakness is
present in all NM forms, including childhood-onset NM with
slowness, and may be present irrespective of the degree of
general motor function impairment. These findings highlight the
importance for screening of respiratory function in patients
with NM to guide respiratory management.},
