abstract: In this cross-sectional study, we comprehensively assessed respiratory muscle
  function in various clinical forms of nemaline myopathy (NM) including non-volitional
  tests for diaphragm function. Forty-two patients with NM were included (10 males
  (25-74 y/o); 32 females (11-76 y/o)). The NM forms were typical (n=11), mild (n=7),
  or childhood-onset with slowness of movements (n=24). Forced vital capacity (FVC)
  and maximal inspiratory pressure were decreased in typical NM in comparison with
  childhood-onset NM with slowness (32.0 [29.0-58.5] vs 81.0 [75.0-87.0]%, p<0.01,
  and 35.0 [24.0-55.0] vs 81.0 [65.0-102.5] cmH2O, p<0.01). Eight patients with childhood-onset
  NM with slowness had respiratory muscle weakness. There was a low correlation between
  FVC and Motor Function Measure scores (r=0.48, p<0.01). End-inspiratory diaphragm
  thickness and twitch mouth pressure were decreased in patients requiring home mechanical
  ventilation compared to non-ventilated patients with normal lung function (1.8 [1.5-2.4]
  vs 3.1 [2.0-4.6] mm, p=0.049, and -7.9 [-10.9- -4.0] vs -14.9 [-17.3- -12.6], p=0.04).
  Our results show that respiratory muscle weakness is present in all NM forms, including
  childhood-onset NM with slowness, and may be present irrespective of the degree
  of general motor function impairment. These findings highlight the importance for
  screening of respiratory function in patients with NM to guide respiratory management.
