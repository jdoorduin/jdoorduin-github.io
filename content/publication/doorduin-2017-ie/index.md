abstract: 'RATIONALE: Controlled mechanical ventilation is used to deliver lung-protective
  ventilation in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome. Despite recognized
  benefits, such as preserved diaphragm activity, partial support ventilation modes
  may be incompatible with lung-protective ventilation due to high Vt and high transpulmonary
  pressure. As an alternative to high-dose sedatives and controlled mechanical ventilation,
  pharmacologically induced neuromechanical uncoupling of the diaphragm should facilitate
  lung-protective ventilation under partial support modes. OBJECTIVES: To investigate
  whether partial neuromuscular blockade can facilitate lung-protective ventilation
  while maintaining diaphragm activity under partial ventilatory support. METHODS:
  In a proof-of-concept study, we enrolled 10 patients with lung injury and a Vt greater
  than 8 ml/kg under pressure support ventilation (PSV) and under sedation. After
  baseline measurements, rocuronium administration was titrated to a target Vt of
  6 ml/kg during neurally adjusted ventilatory assist (NAVA). Thereafter, patients
  were ventilated in PSV and NAVA under continuous rocuronium infusion for 2 hours.
  Respiratory parameters, hemodynamic parameters, and blood gas values were measured.
  MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Rocuronium titration resulted in significant declines
  of Vt (mean $±$ SEM, 9.3 $±$ 0.6 to 5.6 $±$ 0.2 ml/kg; P < 0.0001), transpulmonary
  pressure (26.7 $±$ 2.5 to 10.7 $±$ 1.2 cm H2O; P < 0.0001), and diaphragm electrical
  activity (17.4 $±$ 2.3 to 4.5 $±$ 0.7 $μ$V; P < 0.0001), and could be maintained
  under continuous rocuronium infusion. During titration, pH decreased (7.42 $±$ 0.02
  to 7.35 $±$ 0.02; P < 0.0001), and mean arterial blood pressure increased (84 $±$
  6 to 99 $±$ 6 mm Hg; P = 0.0004), as did heart rate (83 $±$ 7 to 93 $±$ 8 beats/min;
  P = 0.0004). CONCLUSIONS: Partial neuromuscular blockade facilitates lung-protective
  ventilation during partial ventilatory support, while maintaining diaphragm activity,
  in sedated patients with lung injury.'
