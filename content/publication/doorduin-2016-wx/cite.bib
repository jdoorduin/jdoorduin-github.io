 abstract = {BACKGROUND: Physiological dead space (VD/VT) represents the
fraction of ventilation not participating in gas exchange. In
patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), VD/VT
has prognostic value and can be used to guide ventilator
settings. However, VD/VT is rarely calculated in clinical
practice, because its measurement is perceived as challenging.
Recently, a novel technique to calculate partial pressure of
carbon dioxide in alveolar air (PACO2) using volumetric
capnography (VCap) was validated. The purpose of the present
study was to evaluate how VCap and other available techniques to
measure PACO2 and partial pressure of carbon dioxide in mixed
expired air (PeCO2) affect calculated VD/VT. METHODS: In a
prospective, observational study, 15 post-cardiac surgery
patients and 15 patients with ARDS were included. PACO2 was
measured using VCap to calculate Bohr dead space or substituted
with partial pressure of carbon dioxide in arterial blood
(PaCO2) to calculate the Enghoff modification. PeCO2 was
measured in expired air using three techniques: Douglas bag
(DBag), indirect calorimetry (InCal), and VCap. Subsequently,
VD/VT was calculated using four methods: Enghoff-DBag,
Enghoff-InCal, Enghoff-VCap, and Bohr-VCap. RESULTS: PaCO2 was
higher than PACO2, particularly in patients with ARDS
(post-cardiac surgery PACO2 = 4.3 $±$ 0.6 kPa vs. PaCO2 = 5.2
$±$ 0.5 kPa, P < 0.05; ARDS PACO2 = 3.9 $±$ 0.8 kPa vs.
PaCO2 = 6.9 $±$ 1.7 kPa, P < 0.05). There was good agreement
in PeCO2 calculated with DBag vs. VCap (post-cardiac surgery
bias = 0.04 $±$ 0.19 kPa; ARDS bias = 0.03 $±$ 0.27 kPa) and
relatively low agreement with DBag vs. InCal (post-cardiac
surgery bias = -1.17 $±$ 0.50 kPa; ARDS mean bias = -0.15
$±$ 0.53 kPa). These differences strongly affected calculated
VD/VT. For example, in patients with ARDS, VD/VTcalculated with
Enghoff-InCal was much higher than Bohr-VCap (VD/VT
Enghoff-InCal = 66 $±$ 10 % vs. VD/VT Bohr-VCap = 45 $±$ 7
%; P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Different techniques to measure
PACO2 and PeCO2 result in clinically relevant mean and
individual differences in calculated VD/VT, particularly in
patients with ARDS. Volumetric capnography is a promising
technique to calculate true Bohr dead space. Our results
demonstrate the challenges clinicians face in interpreting an
apparently simple measurement such as VD/VT.},
