abstract: "BACKGROUND: Respiratory muscle training (RMT) aims to improve inspiratory
  and/or expiratory muscle function in neuromuscular disorders (NMDs). A comprehensive
  overview of the available literature is lacking. This scoping review explores methodological
  characteristics, (adverse) effects, and adherence of RMT studies in NMDs. Moreover,
  it identifies limitations and research gaps in the literature and provides future
  research directions. SUMMARY: Eligible studies were identified using MEDLINE, Embase,
  Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled
  Trials databases. Three reviewers independently selected articles. Inclusion criteria
  were English language, original research articles on RMT using a device, patients
  with an NMD, and pulmonary function tests or respiratory muscle strength as outcome
  measures. We included NMDs with slow, intermediate and fast progression. Exclusion
  criteria were critically ill patients, weaning from mechanical ventilation, other
  neurological disorders, and RMT combined with non-respiratory interventions. One
  reviewer extracted the data on patients' characteristics, methodological characteristics,
  results of outcome measures, adverse events, and patient adherence. Forty-five studies
  were identified. We found a large diversity in study designs and training protocols.
  The effects of RMT on respiratory muscle strength and/or endurance are variable.
  Patient adherence was high and no serious adverse events were reported. KEY MESSAGES:
  The diversity in studies across the available literature precludes definitive conclusions
  regarding the effects of RMT on respiratory muscle function and clinically relevant
  outcomes in NMDs. Therefore, well-powered and -designed studies that focus on clinically
  relevant outcomes and assess whether RMT can improve or offset deterioration of
  respiratory muscle weakness in NMDs are needed."
