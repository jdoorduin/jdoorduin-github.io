 abstract = {BACKGROUND: Respiratory muscle training (RMT) aims to improve
inspiratory and/or expiratory muscle function in neuromuscular
disorders (NMDs). A comprehensive overview of the available
literature is lacking. This scoping review explores
methodological characteristics, (adverse) effects, and adherence
of RMT studies in NMDs. Moreover, it identifies limitations and
research gaps in the literature and provides future research
directions. SUMMARY: Eligible studies were identified using
MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and
Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases. Three
reviewers independently selected articles. Inclusion criteria
were English language, original research articles on RMT using a
device, patients with an NMD, and pulmonary function tests or
respiratory muscle strength as outcome measures. We included
NMDs with slow, intermediate and fast progression. Exclusion
criteria were critically ill patients, weaning from mechanical
ventilation, other neurological disorders, and RMT combined with
non-respiratory interventions. One reviewer extracted the data
on patients' characteristics, methodological characteristics,
results of outcome measures, adverse events, and patient
adherence. Forty-five studies were identified. We found a large
diversity in study designs and training protocols. The effects
of RMT on respiratory muscle strength and/or endurance are
variable. Patient adherence was high and no serious adverse
events were reported. KEY MESSAGES: The diversity in studies
across the available literature precludes definitive conclusions
regarding the effects of RMT on respiratory muscle function and
clinically relevant outcomes in NMDs. Therefore, well-powered
and -designed studies that focus on clinically relevant outcomes
and assess whether RMT can improve or offset deterioration of
respiratory muscle weakness in NMDs are needed.},
