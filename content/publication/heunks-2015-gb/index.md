abstract: 'PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The present review summarizes developments in the field
  of respiratory muscle monitoring, in particular in critically ill patients. RECENT
  FINDINGS: Patients admitted to the ICU may develop severe respiratory muscle dysfunction
  in a very short time span. Among other factors, disuse and sepsis have been associated
  with respiratory muscle dysfunction in these patients. Because weakness is associated
  with adverse outcome, including prolonged mechanical ventilation and mortality,
  it is surprising that respiratory muscle dysfunction largely develops without being
  noticed by the clinician. Respiratory muscle monitoring is not standard of care
  in most ICUs. Improvements in technology have opened windows for monitoring the
  respiratory muscles in critically ill patients. Diaphragm electromyography and esophageal
  pressure measurement are feasible techniques for respiratory muscle monitoring,
  although the effect on outcome remains to be investigated. SUMMARY: Respiratory
  muscle dysfunction develops rapidly in selected critically ill patients and is associated
  with adverse outcome. Recent technological advances allow real-time monitoring of
  respiratory muscle activity in these patients. Although this field is in its infancy,
  from a physiological perspective, it is reasonable to assume that monitoring respiratory
  muscle activity improves outcome in these patients.'
