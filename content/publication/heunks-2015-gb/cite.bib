 abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The present review summarizes developments in
the field of respiratory muscle monitoring, in particular in
critically ill patients. RECENT FINDINGS: Patients admitted to
the ICU may develop severe respiratory muscle dysfunction in a
very short time span. Among other factors, disuse and sepsis
have been associated with respiratory muscle dysfunction in
these patients. Because weakness is associated with adverse
outcome, including prolonged mechanical ventilation and
mortality, it is surprising that respiratory muscle dysfunction
largely develops without being noticed by the clinician.
Respiratory muscle monitoring is not standard of care in most
ICUs. Improvements in technology have opened windows for
monitoring the respiratory muscles in critically ill patients.
Diaphragm electromyography and esophageal pressure measurement
are feasible techniques for respiratory muscle monitoring,
although the effect on outcome remains to be investigated.
SUMMARY: Respiratory muscle dysfunction develops rapidly in
selected critically ill patients and is associated with adverse
outcome. Recent technological advances allow real-time
monitoring of respiratory muscle activity in these patients.
Although this field is in its infancy, from a physiological
perspective, it is reasonable to assume that monitoring
respiratory muscle activity improves outcome in these patients.},
