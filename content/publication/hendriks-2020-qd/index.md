abstract: "OBJECT: Surgery of tumours in the cerebellopontine angle (CPA) can lead
  to loss of facial nerve function. Different methods of intra-operative nerve monitoring
  (IOM) (including free-running EMG, direct nerve stimulation and transcranial motor
  evoked potentials (TcMEP)) have been used to predict facial nerve outcome during
  surgery. Recent research has shown TcMEP threshold increase and the occurrence of
  A-trains on the EMG to have great potential in doing so. This study compares these
  two methods and correlates them to House-Brackmann (HB) scores post-op in patients
  with tumours in the cerebellopontine angle. METHOD: Forty-three patients (one was
  operated twice) with large CPA tumours treated surgically in the Radboud University
  Medical Center between 2015 and 2019 were included in this study. During surgery,
  TcMEP threshold increases and A-train activity were measured. Because our treatment
  paradigm aims at facial nerve preservation (accepting residual tumour), TcMEP threshold
  increase of over 20 mA or occurrence of A-trains were considered as warning signs
  and used as a guide for terminating surgery. HB scores were measured post-op, at
  6 weeks, 6 months and 1 year after surgery. Spearman's correlation was calculated
  between the IOM-values and the HB scores for a homogeneous subgroup of 30 patients
  with vestibular schwannoma (VS) without neurofibromatosis type II (NF-II) and all
  patients collectively. RESULTS: TcMEP threshold was successfully measured in 39
  (90.7%) procedures. In the homogeneous VS non-NFII group, we found a statistically
  significant moderate-to-strong correlation between TcMEP threshold increase and
  House Brackmann score immediately post-op, at 6 weeks, 6 months and 1 year after
  surgery (Spearman's rho of 0.79 (p < 0.001), 0.74 (p < 0.001), 0.64 (p < 0.001)
  and 0.58 (p = 0.002), respectively). For A-trains, no correlation was found. Similar
  results were found when including all patients with CPA tumours. A threshold increase
  of < 20 mA was a predictor of good facial nerve outcome. CONCLUSION: These results
  show that TcMEP threshold increases are strongly correlated to post-operative HB
  scores, while A-trains are not. This suggests TcMEP threshold increases can be a
  valuable predictor for facial nerve outcome in patients with large tumours when
  facial nerve preservation is prioritized over total resection. In this study, we
  found no use for A-trains to prevent facial nerve deficits."
