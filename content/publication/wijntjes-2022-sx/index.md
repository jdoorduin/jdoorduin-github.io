abstract: 'INTRODUCTION/AIMS: Visual and quantitative muscle ultrasound are both valid
  diagnostic tools in neuromuscular diseases. To optimize muscle ultrasound evaluation
  and facilitate its use in neuromuscular disease, we examined the correlation between
  visual and quantitative muscle ultrasound analysis and their pitfalls. METHODS:
  Retrospective data from 994 patients with 13,562 muscle ultrasound images were analyzed.
  Differences in echogenicity z-score distribution per Heckmatt grade and corresponding
  correlation coefficients were calculated. RESULTS: Overall, there was a correlation
  of 0.60 between the two scoring systems, with a gradual increase in z-score with
  increasing Heckmatt grades and vice versa. Patients with a neuromuscular disorder
  had higher Heckmatt grades (p < 0.001) and z-scores (median z-score = 0.30, p <
  0.001) than patients without. The highest Heckmatt grades and z-scores were found
  in patients with either a dystrophy or inflammatory myopathy (both median Heckmatt
  grade of 2 and median z score of 0.74 and 1.20, respectively). Discrepant scores
  were infrequent (<2%), but revealed important pitfalls in both grading systems.
  DISCUSSION: Visual and quantitative muscle ultrasound are complementary techniques
  to evaluate neuromuscular disease and have a moderate positive correlation. Importantly,
  we identified specific pitfalls for visual and quantitative muscle ultrasound and
  how to overcome them in clinical practice.'
