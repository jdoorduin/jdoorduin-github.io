abstract: 'Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the motor cortex can be used
  during a voluntary contraction to inhibit corticospinal drive to the muscle and
  consequently induce involuntary muscle relaxation. Our aim was to evaluate the reproducibility
  and the effect of varying experimental conditions (robustness) of TMS-induced muscle
  relaxation. Relaxation of deep finger flexors was assessed in 10 healthy subjects
  (5 M, 5 F) using handgrip dynamometry with normalized peak relaxation rate as main
  outcome measure, that is, peak relaxation rate divided by (voluntary plus TMS-evoked)force
  prior to relaxation. Both interday and interrater reliability of relaxation rate
  were high with intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.88 and 0.92 and coefficient
  of variation of 3.8 and 3.7%, respectively. Target forces of 37.5% of maximal voluntary
  force or higher resulted in similar relaxation rate. From 50% of maximal stimulator
  output and higher relaxation rate remained the same. Only the most lateral position
  (>2 cm from the vertex) rendered lower relaxation rate (mean $±$ SD: 11.1 $±$ 3.0
  s-1 , 95% CI: 9.0-13.3 s-1 ) compared to stimulation at the vertex (12.8 $±$ 1.89
  s-1 , 95% CI: 11.6-14.1 s-1 ). Within the range of baseline skin temperatures, an
  average change of 0.5 $±$ 0.2 s-1 in normalized peak relaxation rate was measured
  per 1°C change in skin temperature. In conclusion, interday and interrater reproducibility
  and reliability of TMS-induced muscle relaxation of the finger flexors were high.
  Furthermore, this technique is robust with limited effect of target force, stimulation
  intensity, and coil position. Muscle relaxation is strongly affected by skin temperature;
  however, this effect is marginal within the normal skin temperature range. We deem
  this technique well suited for clinical and scientific assessment of muscle relaxation.'
