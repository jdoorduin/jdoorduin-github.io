 abstract = {Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the motor cortex can
be used during a voluntary contraction to inhibit corticospinal
drive to the muscle and consequently induce involuntary muscle
relaxation. Our aim was to evaluate the reproducibility and the
effect of varying experimental conditions (robustness) of
TMS-induced muscle relaxation. Relaxation of deep finger flexors
was assessed in 10 healthy subjects (5 M, 5 F) using handgrip
dynamometry with normalized peak relaxation rate as main outcome
measure, that is, peak relaxation rate divided by (voluntary
plus TMS-evoked)force prior to relaxation. Both interday and
interrater reliability of relaxation rate were high with
intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.88 and 0.92 and
coefficient of variation of 3.8 and 3.7%, respectively. Target
forces of 37.5% of maximal voluntary force or higher resulted
in similar relaxation rate. From 50% of maximal stimulator
output and higher relaxation rate remained the same. Only the
most lateral position (>2 cm from the vertex) rendered lower
relaxation rate (mean $±$ SD: 11.1 $±$ 3.0 s-1 , 95% CI:
9.0-13.3 s-1 ) compared to stimulation at the vertex (12.8 $±$
1.89 s-1 , 95% CI: 11.6-14.1 s-1 ). Within the range of
baseline skin temperatures, an average change of 0.5 $±$ 0.2
s-1 in normalized peak relaxation rate was measured per 1°C
change in skin temperature. In conclusion, interday and
interrater reproducibility and reliability of TMS-induced muscle
relaxation of the finger flexors were high. Furthermore, this
technique is robust with limited effect of target force,
stimulation intensity, and coil position. Muscle relaxation is
strongly affected by skin temperature; however, this effect is
marginal within the normal skin temperature range. We deem this
technique well suited for clinical and scientific assessment of
muscle relaxation.},
