 abstract = {BACKGROUND: Motor cortex stimulation (MCS) was introduced as a
last-resort treatment for chronic neuropathic pain. Over the
years, MCS has been used for the treatment of various pain
syndromes but long-term follow-up is unknown. METHODS: This paper
reports the results of MCS from 2005 until 2012 with a 3-year
follow-up. Patients who suffered from chronic neuropathic pain
treated with MCS were studied. The analgesic effect was
determined as successful by decrease in pain-intensity on the
visual analog scale (VAS) of at least 40%. The modifications in
drug regimens were monitored with use of the medication
quantification scale (MQS). Stimulation parameters and
complications were also noted. Interference of pain with quality
of life (QoL), the Quality of Life Index (QLI), was determined
with use of a specific subset of questions from the MPQ-DLV
score. RESULTS: Eighteen patients were included. Mean
pre-operative VAS changed from 89.4 $±$ 11.2 to 53.1 $±$ 25.0
after three years of follow-up (P < 0.0001). A successful outcome
was achieved in seven responders (38.9%). All patients in the
responder group suffered from pain caused by a central lesion.
With regard to all the patients with central pain lesions (n =
10) and peripheral lesions (n = 8), a significant difference in
response to MCS was noticed (P = 0.002). MQS scores and
QLI-scores diminished during the follow-up period (P = 0.210 and
P = 0.007, respectively). CONCLUSION: MCS seems a promising
therapeutic option for patients with refractory pain syndromes of
central origin.},
