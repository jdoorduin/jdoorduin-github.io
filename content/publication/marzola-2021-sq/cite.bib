 abstract = {Ultrasound imaging is a patient-friendly and robust technique
for studying physiological and pathological muscles. An
automatic deep learning (DL) system for the analysis of
ultrasound images could be useful to support an expert operator,
allowing the study of large datasets requiring less human
interaction. The purpose of this study is to present a deep
learning algorithm for the cross-sectional area (CSA)
segmentation in transverse musculoskeletal ultrasound images,
providing a quantitative grayscale analysis which is useful for
studying muscles, and to validate the results in a large
dataset. The dataset included 3917 images of biceps brachii,
tibialis anterior and gastrocnemius medialis acquired on 1283
subjects (mean age 50 $±$ 21 years, 729 male). The algorithm
was based on multiple deep-learning architectures, and its
performance was compared to a manual expert segmentation. We
compared the mean grayscale value inside the automatic and
manual CSA using Bland-Altman plots and a correlation analysis.
Classification in healthy and abnormal muscles between automatic
and manual segmentation were compared using the grayscale value
z-scores. In the test set, a Precision of 0.88 $±$ 0.12 and a
Recall of 0.92 $±$ 0.09 was achieved. The network segmentation
performance was slightly less in abnormal muscles, without a
loss of discrimination between healthy and abnormal muscle
images. Bland-Altman plots showed no clear trend in the error
distribution and the two readings have a 0.99 Pearson's
correlation coefficient (p < 0.001, test set). The ICC(A, 1)
calculated between the z-score readings was 0.99. The algorithm
achieves robust CSA segmentation performance and gives mean
grayscale level information comparable to a manual operator.
This could provide a helpful tool for clinicians in
neuromuscular disease diagnosis and follow-up. The entire
dataset and code are made available for the research community.},
