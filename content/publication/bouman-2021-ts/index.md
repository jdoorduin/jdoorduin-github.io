abstract: "BACKGROUND: SELENON (SEPN1)-related myopathy (SELENON-RM) is a rare congenital
  myopathy characterized by slowly progressive proximal muscle weakness, early onset
  spine rigidity and respiratory insufficiency. A muscular dystrophy caused by mutations
  in the LAMA2 gene (LAMA2-related muscular dystrophy, LAMA2-MD) has a similar clinical
  phenotype, with either a severe, early-onset due to complete Laminin subunit $α$2
  deficiency (merosin-deficient congenital muscular dystrophy type 1A (MDC1A)), or
  a mild, childhood- or adult-onset due to partial Laminin subunit $α$2 deficiency.
  For both muscle diseases, no curative treatment options exist, yet promising preclinical
  studies are ongoing. Currently, there is a paucity on natural history data and appropriate
  clinical and functional outcome measures are needed to reach trial readiness. METHODS:
  LAST STRONG is a natural history study in Dutch-speaking patients of all ages diagnosed
  with SELENON-RM or LAMA2-MD, starting August 2020. Patients have four visits at
  our hospital over a period of 1.5 year. At all visits, they undergo standardized
  neurological examination, hand-held dynamometry (age $≥$ 5 years), functional measurements,
  questionnaires (patient report and/or parent proxy; age $≥$ 2 years), muscle ultrasound
  including diaphragm, pulmonary function tests (spirometry, maximal inspiratory and
  expiratory pressure, sniff nasal inspiratory pressure; age $≥$ 5 years), and accelerometry
  for 8 days (age $≥$ 2 years); at visit one and three, they undergo cardiac evaluation
  (electrocardiogram, echocardiography; age $≥$ 2 years), spine X-ray (age $≥$ 2 years),
  dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA-)scan (age $≥$ 2 years) and full body magnetic
  resonance imaging (MRI) (age $≥$ 10 years). All examinations are adapted to the
  patient's age and functional abilities. Correlation between key parameters within
  and between subsequent visits will be assessed. DISCUSSION: Our study will describe
  the natural history of patients diagnosed with SELENON-RM or LAMA2-MD, enabling
  us to select relevant clinical and functional outcome measures for reaching clinical
  trial-readiness. Moreover, our detailed description (deep phenotyping) of the clinical
  features will optimize clinical management and will establish a well-characterized
  baseline cohort for prospective follow-up. CONCLUSION: Our natural history study
  is an essential step for reaching trial readiness in SELENON-RM and LAMA2-MD. TRIAL
  REGISTRATION: This study has been approved by medical ethical reviewing committee
  Region Arnhem-Nijmegen (NL64269.091.17, 2017-3911) and is registered at ClinicalTrial.gov
  ( NCT04478981 )."
