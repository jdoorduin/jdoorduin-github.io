 abstract = {BACKGROUND: SELENON (SEPN1)-related myopathy (SELENON-RM) is a
rare congenital myopathy characterized by slowly progressive
proximal muscle weakness, early onset spine rigidity and
respiratory insufficiency. A muscular dystrophy caused by
mutations in the LAMA2 gene (LAMA2-related muscular dystrophy,
LAMA2-MD) has a similar clinical phenotype, with either a
severe, early-onset due to complete Laminin subunit $α$2
deficiency (merosin-deficient congenital muscular dystrophy type
1A (MDC1A)), or a mild, childhood- or adult-onset due to partial
Laminin subunit $α$2 deficiency. For both muscle diseases,
no curative treatment options exist, yet promising preclinical
studies are ongoing. Currently, there is a paucity on natural
history data and appropriate clinical and functional outcome
measures are needed to reach trial readiness. METHODS: LAST
STRONG is a natural history study in Dutch-speaking patients of
all ages diagnosed with SELENON-RM or LAMA2-MD, starting August
2020. Patients have four visits at our hospital over a period of
1.5 year. At all visits, they undergo standardized neurological
examination, hand-held dynamometry (age $≥$ 5 years),
functional measurements, questionnaires (patient report and/or
parent proxy; age $≥$ 2 years), muscle ultrasound including
diaphragm, pulmonary function tests (spirometry, maximal
inspiratory and expiratory pressure, sniff nasal inspiratory
pressure; age $≥$ 5 years), and accelerometry for 8 days (age
$≥$ 2 years); at visit one and three, they undergo cardiac
evaluation (electrocardiogram, echocardiography; age $≥$ 2
years), spine X-ray (age $≥$ 2 years), dual-energy X-ray
absorptiometry (DEXA-)scan (age $≥$ 2 years) and full body
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (age $≥$ 10 years). All
examinations are adapted to the patient's age and functional
abilities. Correlation between key parameters within and between
subsequent visits will be assessed. DISCUSSION: Our study will
describe the natural history of patients diagnosed with
SELENON-RM or LAMA2-MD, enabling us to select relevant clinical
and functional outcome measures for reaching clinical
trial-readiness. Moreover, our detailed description (deep
phenotyping) of the clinical features will optimize clinical
management and will establish a well-characterized baseline
cohort for prospective follow-up. CONCLUSION: Our natural
history study is an essential step for reaching trial readiness
in SELENON-RM and LAMA2-MD. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This study has
been approved by medical ethical reviewing committee Region
Arnhem-Nijmegen (NL64269.091.17, 2017-3911) and is registered at
ClinicalTrial.gov ( NCT04478981 ).},
