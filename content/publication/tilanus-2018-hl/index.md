abstract: "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) is an established
  treatment for respiratory failure in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
  (ALS). Several studies have shown room for improvement with regard to respiratory
  care for ALS patients, including latency of referral. These studies focused on the
  time period starting at the moment of referral to a home ventilation service (HVS)
  onwards. In the current study we performed a nationwide survey to gain insight in
  the trajectory before referral. We questioned the assessment of respiratory impairment
  by ALS physicians/care teams, including criteria for referral to an HVS. METHODS:
  We requested 40 ALS care teams in the Netherlands to fill in an online questionnaire
  on respiratory management in ALS patients. RESULTS: Thirty-two ALS care teams (80%)
  responded. Forced vital capacity was the most frequently used test at each outpatient
  visit (72%) and often served as a criterion (78%) for referral to an HVS. Other
  respiratory function measurements that were performed less often included peak cough
  flow (50%), maximum inspiratory/expiratory pressure (31% /28%) and sniff nasal inspiratory
  pressure (13%). Morning headache was the most frequently questioned complaint (94%),
  followed by daytime sleepiness (91%). Dyspnoea and orthopnoea were reported by 38%
  and 59% as important complaints. Out of all patients under the care of the ALS care
  teams, the mean estimated proportion of patients that was referred to an HVS was
  69% (range 20-100%). When physicians refrained from referral, the most often cited
  reasons were patient's decision to withhold NIV (94%) and cognitive impairment (50%).
  Sixteen percent of the respondents stated bulbar impairment as a reason to refrain
  from referral. CONCLUSION: Despite findings in previous studies on the superiority
  of SNIP and PCF as compared to FVC, our study shows that a majority of ALS care
  teams still prefers to use FVC for the assessment of respiratory dysfunction and
  for the timing of referral to an HVS. Another finding is that bulbar impairment
  is not an obstacle for referral for NIV."
