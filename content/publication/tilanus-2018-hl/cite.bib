 abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) is an
established treatment for respiratory failure in patients with
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Several studies have shown
room for improvement with regard to respiratory care for ALS
patients, including latency of referral. These studies focused
on the time period starting at the moment of referral to a home
ventilation service (HVS) onwards. In the current study we
performed a nationwide survey to gain insight in the trajectory
before referral. We questioned the assessment of respiratory
impairment by ALS physicians/care teams, including criteria for
referral to an HVS. METHODS: We requested 40 ALS care teams in
the Netherlands to fill in an online questionnaire on
respiratory management in ALS patients. RESULTS: Thirty-two ALS
care teams (80%) responded. Forced vital capacity was the most
frequently used test at each outpatient visit (72%) and often
served as a criterion (78%) for referral to an HVS. Other
respiratory function measurements that were performed less often
included peak cough flow (50%), maximum inspiratory/expiratory
pressure (31% /28%) and sniff nasal inspiratory pressure
(13%). Morning headache was the most frequently questioned
complaint (94%), followed by daytime sleepiness (91%).
Dyspnoea and orthopnoea were reported by 38% and 59% as
important complaints. Out of all patients under the care of the
ALS care teams, the mean estimated proportion of patients that
was referred to an HVS was 69% (range 20-100%). When
physicians refrained from referral, the most often cited reasons
were patient's decision to withhold NIV (94%) and cognitive
impairment (50%). Sixteen percent of the respondents stated
bulbar impairment as a reason to refrain from referral.
CONCLUSION: Despite findings in previous studies on the
superiority of SNIP and PCF as compared to FVC, our study shows
that a majority of ALS care teams still prefers to use FVC for
the assessment of respiratory dysfunction and for the timing of
referral to an HVS. Another finding is that bulbar impairment is
not an obstacle for referral for NIV.},
