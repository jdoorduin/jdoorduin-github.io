abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Patients with acute respiratory failure may develop respiratory
  acidosis. Metabolic compensation by bicarbonate production or retention results
  in posthypercapnic alkalosis with an increased arterial bicarbonate concentration.
  The hypothesis of this study was that elevated plasma bicarbonate levels decrease
  respiratory drive and minute ventilation. METHODS: In an intervention study in 10
  healthy subjects the ventilatory response using a hypercapnic ventilatory response
  (HCVR) test was assessed, before and after administration of high dose sodium bicarbonate.
  Total dose of sodiumbicarbonate was 1000 ml 8.4% in 3 days. RESULTS: Plasma bicarbonate
  increased from 25.2 $±$ 2.2 to 29.2 $±$ 1.9 mmol/L. With increasing inspiratory
  CO2 pressure during the HCVR test, RR, Vt, Pdi, EAdi and VE increased. The clinical
  ratio $Δ$VE/$Δ$PetCO2 remained unchanged, but Pdi, EAdi and VE were significantly
  lower after bicarbonate administration for similar levels of inspired CO2. CONCLUSION:
  This study demonstrates that in healthy subjects metabolic alkalosis decreases the
  neural respiratory drive and minute ventilation, as a response to inspiratory CO2.'
