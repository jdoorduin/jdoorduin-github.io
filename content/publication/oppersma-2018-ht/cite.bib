 abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patients with acute respiratory failure may develop
respiratory acidosis. Metabolic compensation by bicarbonate
production or retention results in posthypercapnic alkalosis with
an increased arterial bicarbonate concentration. The hypothesis
of this study was that elevated plasma bicarbonate levels
decrease respiratory drive and minute ventilation. METHODS: In an
intervention study in 10 healthy subjects the ventilatory
response using a hypercapnic ventilatory response (HCVR) test was
assessed, before and after administration of high dose sodium
bicarbonate. Total dose of sodiumbicarbonate was 1000 ml 8.4% in
3 days. RESULTS: Plasma bicarbonate increased from 25.2 $±$ 2.2
to 29.2 $±$ 1.9 mmol/L. With increasing inspiratory CO2
pressure during the HCVR test, RR, Vt, Pdi, EAdi and VE
increased. The clinical ratio $Δ$VE/$Δ$PetCO2 remained
unchanged, but Pdi, EAdi and VE were significantly lower after
bicarbonate administration for similar levels of inspired CO2.
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that in healthy subjects
metabolic alkalosis decreases the neural respiratory drive and
minute ventilation, as a response to inspiratory CO2.},
