 abstract = {BACKGROUND: Respiratory muscle weakness is a common feature in
nemaline myopathy. Inspiratory muscle training (IMT) is an
intervention that aims to improve inspiratory muscle strength.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this controlled before-and-after pilot
study was to investigate if IMT improves respiratory muscle
strength in patients with nemaline myopathy. METHODS: Nine
patients (7 females; 2 males, age 36.6$±$20.5 years) with
respiratory muscle weakness and different clinical phenotypes and
genotypes were included. Patients performed eight weeks of sham
IMT followed by eight weeks of active threshold IMT. The patients
trained twice a day five days a week for 15 minutes at home. The
intensity was constant during the training after a gradual
increase to 30% of maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP). RESULTS:
Active IMT significantly improved MIP from 43$±$15.9 to
47$±$16.6 cmH2O (p = 0.019). The effect size was 1.22. There
was no significant effect of sham IMT. Sniff nasal inspiratory
pressure, maximal expiratory pressure, spirometry, and diaphragm
thickness and thickening showed no significant improvements.
CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study shows that threshold IMT is
feasible in patients with nemaline myopathy and improves
inspiratory muscle strength. Our findings provide valuable
preliminary data for the design of a larger, more comprehensive
trial.},
