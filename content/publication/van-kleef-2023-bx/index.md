abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Respiratory muscle weakness is a common feature in nemaline
  myopathy. Inspiratory muscle training (IMT) is an intervention that aims to improve
  inspiratory muscle strength. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this controlled before-and-after
  pilot study was to investigate if IMT improves respiratory muscle strength in patients
  with nemaline myopathy. METHODS: Nine patients (7 females; 2 males, age 36.6$±$20.5
  years) with respiratory muscle weakness and different clinical phenotypes and genotypes
  were included. Patients performed eight weeks of sham IMT followed by eight weeks
  of active threshold IMT. The patients trained twice a day five days a week for 15
  minutes at home. The intensity was constant during the training after a gradual
  increase to 30% of maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP). RESULTS: Active IMT significantly
  improved MIP from 43$±$15.9 to 47$±$16.6 cmH2O (p = 0.019). The effect size was
  1.22. There was no significant effect of sham IMT. Sniff nasal inspiratory pressure,
  maximal expiratory pressure, spirometry, and diaphragm thickness and thickening
  showed no significant improvements. CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study shows that threshold
  IMT is feasible in patients with nemaline myopathy and improves inspiratory muscle
  strength. Our findings provide valuable preliminary data for the design of a larger,
  more comprehensive trial.'
