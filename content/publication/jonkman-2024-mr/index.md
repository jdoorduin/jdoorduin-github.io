abstract: Surface electromyography (sEMG) can be used to measure the electrical activity
  of the respiratory muscles. The possible applications of sEMG span from patients
  suffering from acute respiratory failure to patients receiving chronic home mechanical
  ventilation, to evaluate muscle function, titrate ventilatory support and guide
  treatment. However, sEMG is mainly used as a monitoring tool for research and its
  use in clinical practice is still limited-in part due to a lack of standardization
  and transparent reporting. During this round table meeting, recommendations on data
  acquisition, processing, interpretation, and potential clinical applications of
  respiratory sEMG were discussed. This paper informs the clinical researcher interested
  in respiratory muscle monitoring about the current state of the art on sEMG, knowledge
  gaps and potential future applications for patients with respiratory failure.
