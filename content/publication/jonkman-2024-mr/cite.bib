 abstract = {Surface electromyography (sEMG) can be used to measure the
electrical activity of the respiratory muscles. The possible
applications of sEMG span from patients suffering from acute
respiratory failure to patients receiving chronic home mechanical
ventilation, to evaluate muscle function, titrate ventilatory
support and guide treatment. However, sEMG is mainly used as a
monitoring tool for research and its use in clinical practice is
still limited-in part due to a lack of standardization and
transparent reporting. During this round table meeting,
recommendations on data acquisition, processing, interpretation,
and potential clinical applications of respiratory sEMG were
discussed. This paper informs the clinical researcher interested
in respiratory muscle monitoring about the current state of the
art on sEMG, knowledge gaps and potential future applications for
patients with respiratory failure.},
