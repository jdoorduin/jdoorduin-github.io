abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Whether the treatment of rhythmic and periodic electroencephalographic
  (EEG) patterns in comatose survivors of cardiac arrest improves outcomes is uncertain.
  METHODS: We conducted an open-label trial of suppressing rhythmic and periodic EEG
  patterns detected on continuous EEG monitoring in comatose survivors of cardiac
  arrest. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to a stepwise strategy of
  antiseizure medications to suppress this activity for at least 48 consecutive hours
  plus standard care (antiseizure-treatment group) or to standard care alone (control
  group); standard care included targeted temperature management in both groups. The
  primary outcome was neurologic outcome according to the score on the Cerebral Performance
  Category (CPC) scale at 3 months, dichotomized as a good outcome (CPC score indicating
  no, mild, or moderate disability) or a poor outcome (CPC score indicating severe
  disability, coma, or death). Secondary outcomes were mortality, length of stay in
  the intensive care unit (ICU), and duration of mechanical ventilation. RESULTS:
  We enrolled 172 patients, with 88 assigned to the antiseizure-treatment group and
  84 to the control group. Rhythmic or periodic EEG activity was detected a median
  of 35 hours after cardiac arrest; 98 of 157 patients (62%) with available data had
  myoclonus. Complete suppression of rhythmic and periodic EEG activity for 48 consecutive
  hours occurred in 49 of 88 patients (56%) in the antiseizure-treatment group and
  in 2 of 83 patients (2%) in the control group. At 3 months, 79 of 88 patients (90%)
  in the antiseizure-treatment group and 77 of 84 patients (92%) in the control group
  had a poor outcome (difference, 2 percentage points; 95% confidence interval, -7
  to 11; P = 0.68). Mortality at 3 months was 80% in the antiseizure-treatment group
  and 82% in the control group. The mean length of stay in the ICU and mean duration
  of mechanical ventilation were slightly longer in the antiseizure-treatment group
  than in the control group. CONCLUSIONS: In comatose survivors of cardiac arrest,
  the incidence of a poor neurologic outcome at 3 months did not differ significantly
  between a strategy of suppressing rhythmic and periodic EEG activity with the use
  of antiseizure medication for at least 48 hours plus standard care and standard
  care alone. (Funded by the Dutch Epilepsy Foundation; TELSTAR ClinicalTrials.gov
