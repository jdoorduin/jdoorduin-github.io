 abstract = {BACKGROUND: Whether the treatment of rhythmic and periodic
electroencephalographic (EEG) patterns in comatose survivors of
cardiac arrest improves outcomes is uncertain. METHODS: We
conducted an open-label trial of suppressing rhythmic and
periodic EEG patterns detected on continuous EEG monitoring in
comatose survivors of cardiac arrest. Patients were randomly
assigned in a 1:1 ratio to a stepwise strategy of antiseizure
medications to suppress this activity for at least 48
consecutive hours plus standard care (antiseizure-treatment
group) or to standard care alone (control group); standard care
included targeted temperature management in both groups. The
primary outcome was neurologic outcome according to the score on
the Cerebral Performance Category (CPC) scale at 3 months,
dichotomized as a good outcome (CPC score indicating no, mild,
or moderate disability) or a poor outcome (CPC score indicating
severe disability, coma, or death). Secondary outcomes were
mortality, length of stay in the intensive care unit (ICU), and
duration of mechanical ventilation. RESULTS: We enrolled 172
patients, with 88 assigned to the antiseizure-treatment group
and 84 to the control group. Rhythmic or periodic EEG activity
was detected a median of 35 hours after cardiac arrest; 98 of
157 patients (62%) with available data had myoclonus. Complete
suppression of rhythmic and periodic EEG activity for 48
consecutive hours occurred in 49 of 88 patients (56%) in the
antiseizure-treatment group and in 2 of 83 patients (2%) in the
control group. At 3 months, 79 of 88 patients (90%) in the
antiseizure-treatment group and 77 of 84 patients (92%) in the
control group had a poor outcome (difference, 2 percentage
points; 95% confidence interval, -7 to 11; P = 0.68). Mortality
at 3 months was 80% in the antiseizure-treatment group and 82%
in the control group. The mean length of stay in the ICU and
mean duration of mechanical ventilation were slightly longer in
the antiseizure-treatment group than in the control group.
CONCLUSIONS: In comatose survivors of cardiac arrest, the
incidence of a poor neurologic outcome at 3 months did not
differ significantly between a strategy of suppressing rhythmic
and periodic EEG activity with the use of antiseizure medication
for at least 48 hours plus standard care and standard care
alone. (Funded by the Dutch Epilepsy Foundation; TELSTAR
