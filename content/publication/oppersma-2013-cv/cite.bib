 abstract = {In an effort to reduce the complications related to invasive
ventilation, the use of noninvasive ventilation (NIV) has
increased over the last years in patients with acute respiratory
failure. However, failure rates for NIV remain high in specific
patient categories. Several studies have identified factors that
contribute to NIV failure, including low experience of the
medical team and patient-ventilator asynchrony. An important
difference between invasive ventilation and NIV is the role of
the upper airway. During invasive ventilation the endotracheal
tube bypasses the upper airway, but during NIV upper airway
patency may play a role in the successful application of NIV. In
response to positive pressure, upper airway patency may decrease
and therefore impair minute ventilation. This paper aims to
discuss the effect of positive pressure ventilation on upper
airway patency and its possible clinical implications, and to
stimulate research in this field.},
