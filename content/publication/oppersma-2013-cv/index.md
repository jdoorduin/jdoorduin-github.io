abstract: In an effort to reduce the complications related to invasive ventilation,
  the use of noninvasive ventilation (NIV) has increased over the last years in patients
  with acute respiratory failure. However, failure rates for NIV remain high in specific
  patient categories. Several studies have identified factors that contribute to NIV
  failure, including low experience of the medical team and patient-ventilator asynchrony.
  An important difference between invasive ventilation and NIV is the role of the
  upper airway. During invasive ventilation the endotracheal tube bypasses the upper
  airway, but during NIV upper airway patency may play a role in the successful application
  of NIV. In response to positive pressure, upper airway patency may decrease and
  therefore impair minute ventilation. This paper aims to discuss the effect of positive
  pressure ventilation on upper airway patency and its possible clinical implications,
  and to stimulate research in this field.
