abstract: "BACKGROUND: In patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS),
  the use of assisted mechanical ventilation is a subject of debate. Assisted ventilation
  has benefits over controlled ventilation, such as preserved diaphragm function and
  improved oxygenation. Therefore, higher level of ``patient control'' of ventilator
  assist may be preferable in ARDS. However, assisted modes may also increase the
  risk of high tidal volumes and lung-distending pressures. The current study aims
  to quantify how differences in freedom to control the ventilator affect lung-protective
  ventilation, breathing pattern variability, and patient-ventilator interaction.
  METHODS: Twelve patients with ARDS were ventilated in a randomized order with assist
  pressure control ventilation (PCV), pressure support ventilation (PSV), and neurally
  adjusted ventilatory assist (NAVA). Transpulmonary pressure, tidal volume, diaphragm
  electrical activity, and patient-ventilator interaction were measured. Respiratory
  variability was assessed using the coefficient of variation of tidal volume. RESULTS:
  During inspiration, transpulmonary pressure was slightly lower with NAVA (10.3 $±$
  0.7, 11.2 $±$ 0.7, and 9.4 $±$ 0.7 cm H2O for PCV, PSV, and NAVA, respectively;
  P < 0.01). Tidal volume was similar between modes (6.6 [5.7 to 7.0], 6.4 [5.8 to
  7.0], and 6.0 [5.6 to 7.3] ml/kg for PCV, PSV, and NAVA, respectively), but respiratory
  variability was higher with NAVA (8.0 [6.4 to 10.0], 7.1 [5.9 to 9.0], and 17.0
  [12.0 to 36.1] % for PCV, PSV, and NAVA, respectively; P < 0.001). Patient-ventilator
  interaction improved with NAVA (6 [5 to 8] % error) compared with PCV (29 [14 to
  52] % error) and PSV (12 [9 to 27] % error); P < 0.0001. CONCLUSION: In patients
  with mild-to-moderate ARDS, increasing freedom to control the ventilator maintains
  lung-protective ventilation in terms of tidal volume and lung-distending pressure,
  but it improves patient-ventilator interaction and preserves respiratory variability."
