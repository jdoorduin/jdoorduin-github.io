 abstract = {The reference method for the assessment of diaphragm function
relies on the measurement of transdiaphragmatic pressure (Pdi).
Local muscle stiffness measured using ultrafast shear wave
elastography (SWE) provides reliable estimates of muscle force
in locomotor muscles. This study aimed at investigating whether
SWE could be used as a surrogate of Pdi to evaluate diaphragm
function. Fifteen healthy volunteers underwent a randomized
stepwise inspiratory loading protocol of 0-60% of maximal
isovolumetric inspiratory pressure during closed-airways
maneuvers and 0-50% during ventilation against an external
inspiratory threshold load. During all tasks, Pdi was measured
and SWE was used to assess shear modulus of the right
hemidiaphragm (SMdi) at the zone of apposition. Pearson
correlation coefficients ( r) and repeated-measures correlation
coefficients ( R) were computed to determine within-individual
and overall relationships between Pdi and SMdi, respectively.
During closed-airways maneuvers, mean Pdi correlated to mean
SMdi in all participants [ r ranged from 0.77 to 0.96, all P <
0.01; R = 0.82, 95% confidence intervals (0.76, 0.86), P <
0.01]. During ventilation against inspiratory threshold loading,
Pdi swing correlated to maximal SMdi in all participants [ r
ranged from 0.40 to 0.90, all P < 0.01; R = 0.70, 95%
confidence intervals (0.66, 0.73), P < 0.001]. Changes in
diaphragm stiffness as assessed by SWE reflect changes in
transdiaphragmatic pressure. SWE provides a new opportunity for
direct and noninvasive assessment of diaphragm function. NEW &
NOTEWORTHY Accurate and specific estimation of diaphragm effort
is critical for evaluating and monitoring diaphragm dysfunction.
The measurement of transdiaphragmatic pressure requires the use
of invasive gastric and esophageal probes. In the present work,
we demonstrate that changes in diaphragm stiffness assessed with
ultrasound shear wave elastography reflect changes in
transdiaphragmatic pressure, therefore offering a new
noninvasive method for gauging diaphragm effort.},
