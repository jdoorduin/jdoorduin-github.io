 abstract = {BACKGROUND: Bilateral deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic
nucleus (STN-DBS) has become a cornerstone in the advanced
treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD). Despite its
well-established clinical benefit, there is a significant
variation in the way surgery is performed. Most centers operate
with the patient awake to allow for microelectrode recording
(MER) and intraoperative clinical testing. However, technical
advances in MR imaging and MRI-guided surgery raise the question
whether MER and intraoperative clinical testing still have added
value in DBS-surgery. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the added value of
MER and intraoperative clinical testing to determine final lead
position in awake MRI-guided and stereotactic CT-verified
STN-DBS surgery for PD. METHODS: 29 consecutive patients were
analyzed retrospectively. Patients underwent awake bilateral
STN-DBS with MER and intraoperative clinical testing. The role
of MER and clinical testing in determining final lead position
was evaluated. Furthermore, interobserver variability in
determining the MRI-defined STN along the planned trajectory was
investigated. Clinical improvement was evaluated at 12 months
follow-up and adverse events were recorded. RESULTS: 98% of
final leads were placed in the central MER-track with an
accuracy of 0.88$±$0.45 mm. Interobserver variability of the
MRI-defined STN was 0.84$±$0.09. Compared to baseline, mean
improvement in MDS-UPDRS-III, PDQ-39 and LEDD were 26.7$±$16.0
points (54%) (p < 0.001), 9.0$±$20.0 points (19%) (p =
0.025), and 794$±$434 mg/day (59%) (p < 0.001) respectively.
There were 19 adverse events in 11 patients, one of which (lead
malposition requiring immediate postoperative revision) was a
serious adverse event. CONCLUSION: MER and intraoperative
clinical testing had no additional value in determining final
lead position. These results changed our daily clinical practice
to an asleep MRI-guided and stereotactic CT-verified approach.},
