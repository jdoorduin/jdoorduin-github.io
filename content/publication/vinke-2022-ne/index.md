abstract: "BACKGROUND: Bilateral deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus
  (STN-DBS) has become a cornerstone in the advanced treatment of Parkinson's disease
  (PD). Despite its well-established clinical benefit, there is a significant variation
  in the way surgery is performed. Most centers operate with the patient awake to
  allow for microelectrode recording (MER) and intraoperative clinical testing. However,
  technical advances in MR imaging and MRI-guided surgery raise the question whether
  MER and intraoperative clinical testing still have added value in DBS-surgery. OBJECTIVE:
  To evaluate the added value of MER and intraoperative clinical testing to determine
  final lead position in awake MRI-guided and stereotactic CT-verified STN-DBS surgery
  for PD. METHODS: 29 consecutive patients were analyzed retrospectively. Patients
  underwent awake bilateral STN-DBS with MER and intraoperative clinical testing.
  The role of MER and clinical testing in determining final lead position was evaluated.
  Furthermore, interobserver variability in determining the MRI-defined STN along
  the planned trajectory was investigated. Clinical improvement was evaluated at 12
  months follow-up and adverse events were recorded. RESULTS: 98% of final leads were
  placed in the central MER-track with an accuracy of 0.88$±$0.45 mm. Interobserver
  variability of the MRI-defined STN was 0.84$±$0.09. Compared to baseline, mean improvement
  in MDS-UPDRS-III, PDQ-39 and LEDD were 26.7$±$16.0 points (54%) (p < 0.001), 9.0$±$20.0
  points (19%) (p = 0.025), and 794$±$434 mg/day (59%) (p < 0.001) respectively. There
  were 19 adverse events in 11 patients, one of which (lead malposition requiring
  immediate postoperative revision) was a serious adverse event. CONCLUSION: MER and
  intraoperative clinical testing had no additional value in determining final lead
  position. These results changed our daily clinical practice to an asleep MRI-guided
  and stereotactic CT-verified approach."
