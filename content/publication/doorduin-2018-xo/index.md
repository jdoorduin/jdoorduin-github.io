abstract: "WHAT WE ALREADY KNOW ABOUT THIS TOPIC: WHAT THIS ARTICLE TELLS US THAT
  IS NEW: BACKGROUND:: Respiratory muscle weakness in critically ill patients is associated
  with difficulty in weaning from mechanical ventilation. Previous studies have mainly
  focused on inspiratory muscle activity during weaning; expiratory muscle activity
  is less well understood. The current study describes expiratory muscle activity
  during weaning, including tonic diaphragm activity. The authors hypothesized that
  expiratory muscle effort is greater in patients who fail to wean compared to those
  who wean successfully. METHODS: Twenty adult patients receiving mechanical ventilation
  (more than 72 h) performed a spontaneous breathing trial. Tidal volume, transdiaphragmatic
  pressure, diaphragm electrical activity, and diaphragm neuromechanical efficiency
  were calculated on a breath-by-breath basis. Inspiratory (and expiratory) muscle
  efforts were calculated as the inspiratory esophageal (and expiratory gastric) pressure-time
  products, respectively. RESULTS: Nine patients failed weaning. The contribution
  of the expiratory muscles to total respiratory muscle effort increased in the ``failure''
  group from 13 $±$ 9% at onset to 24 $±$ 10% at the end of the breathing trial (P
  = 0.047); there was no increase in the ``success'' group. Diaphragm electrical activity
  (expressed as the percentage of inspiratory peak) was low at end expiration (failure,
  3 $±$ 2%; success, 4 $±$ 6%) and equal between groups during the entire expiratory
  phase (P = 0.407). Diaphragm neuromechanical efficiency was lower in the failure
  versus success groups (0.38 $±$ 0.16 vs. 0.71 $±$ 0.36 cm H2O/$μ$V; P = 0.054).
  CONCLUSIONS: Weaning failure (vs. success) is associated with increased effort of
  the expiratory muscles and impaired neuromechanical efficiency of the diaphragm
  but no difference in tonic activity of the diaphragm."
