THAT IS NEW: BACKGROUND:: Respiratory muscle weakness in
critically ill patients is associated with difficulty in weaning
from mechanical ventilation. Previous studies have mainly focused
on inspiratory muscle activity during weaning; expiratory muscle
activity is less well understood. The current study describes
expiratory muscle activity during weaning, including tonic
diaphragm activity. The authors hypothesized that expiratory
muscle effort is greater in patients who fail to wean compared to
those who wean successfully. METHODS: Twenty adult patients
receiving mechanical ventilation (more than 72 h) performed a
spontaneous breathing trial. Tidal volume, transdiaphragmatic
pressure, diaphragm electrical activity, and diaphragm
neuromechanical efficiency were calculated on a breath-by-breath
basis. Inspiratory (and expiratory) muscle efforts were
calculated as the inspiratory esophageal (and expiratory gastric)
pressure-time products, respectively. RESULTS: Nine patients
failed weaning. The contribution of the expiratory muscles to
total respiratory muscle effort increased in the ``failure''
group from 13 $±$ 9% at onset to 24 $±$ 10% at the end of
the breathing trial (P = 0.047); there was no increase in the
``success'' group. Diaphragm electrical activity (expressed as
the percentage of inspiratory peak) was low at end expiration
(failure, 3 $±$ 2%; success, 4 $±$ 6%) and equal between
groups during the entire expiratory phase (P = 0.407). Diaphragm
neuromechanical efficiency was lower in the failure versus
success groups (0.38 $±$ 0.16 vs. 0.71 $±$ 0.36 cm
H2O/$μ$V; P = 0.054). CONCLUSIONS: Weaning failure (vs.
success) is associated with increased effort of the expiratory
muscles and impaired neuromechanical efficiency of the diaphragm
but no difference in tonic activity of the diaphragm.},
