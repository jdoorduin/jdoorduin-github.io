 abstract = {BACKGROUND: Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) improves survival and
quality of life in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients.
The timing of referral to a home ventilation service (HVS), which
is in part based on respiratory function tests, has shown room
for improvement. It is currently unknown which respiratory
function test predicts an appropriate timing of the initiation of
NIV. METHODS: We analysed, retrospectively, serial data of five
respiratory function tests: forced vital capacity (FVC), peak
cough flow (PCF), maximum inspiratory and expiratory pressure
(MIP and MEP) and sniff nasal inspiratory pressure (SNIP) in
patients with ALS. Patients who had had at least one assessment
of respiratory function and one visit at the HVS, were included.
Our aim was to detect the test with the highest predictive value
for the need for elective NIV in the following 3 months. We
analysed time curves, currently used cut-off values for referral,
and respiratory function test results between 'NIV indication'
and ŉo-NIV indication' patients. RESULTS: One hundred ten
patients with ALS were included of whom 87 received an NIV
indication; 11.5% had one assessment before receiving an NIV
indication, 88.5% had two or more assessments. The NIV
indication was based on complaints of hypoventilation and/or
proven (nocturnal) hypercapnia. The five respiratory function
tests showed a descending trend during disease progression, where
SNIP showed the greatest decline within the latest 3 months
before NIV indication (mean = -22%). PCF at the time of referral
to the HVS significantly discriminated between the groups
'NIV-indication' and ŉo NIV-indication yet' patients at the
first HVS visit: 259 ($±$92) vs. 348 ($±$137) L/min, p =
0.019. PCF and SNIP showed the best predictive characteristics in
terms of sensitivity. CONCLUSION: SNIP showed the greatest
decline prior to NIV indication and PCF significantly
differentiated 'NIV-indication' from ŉo NIV-indication yet'
patients with ALS. Currently used cut-off values might be
adjusted and other respiratory function tests such as SNIP and
PCF may become part of routine care in patients with ALS in order
to avoid non-timely initiation of (non-invasive) ventilation.},
