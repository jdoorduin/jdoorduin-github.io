abstract: "BACKGROUND: Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) improves survival and quality
  of life in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients. The timing of referral
  to a home ventilation service (HVS), which is in part based on respiratory function
  tests, has shown room for improvement. It is currently unknown which respiratory
  function test predicts an appropriate timing of the initiation of NIV. METHODS:
  We analysed, retrospectively, serial data of five respiratory function tests: forced
  vital capacity (FVC), peak cough flow (PCF), maximum inspiratory and expiratory
  pressure (MIP and MEP) and sniff nasal inspiratory pressure (SNIP) in patients with
  ALS. Patients who had had at least one assessment of respiratory function and one
  visit at the HVS, were included. Our aim was to detect the test with the highest
  predictive value for the need for elective NIV in the following 3 months. We analysed
  time curves, currently used cut-off values for referral, and respiratory function
  test results between 'NIV indication' and ŉo-NIV indication' patients. RESULTS:
  One hundred ten patients with ALS were included of whom 87 received an NIV indication;
  11.5% had one assessment before receiving an NIV indication, 88.5% had two or more
  assessments. The NIV indication was based on complaints of hypoventilation and/or
  proven (nocturnal) hypercapnia. The five respiratory function tests showed a descending
  trend during disease progression, where SNIP showed the greatest decline within
  the latest 3 months before NIV indication (mean = -22%). PCF at the time of referral
  to the HVS significantly discriminated between the groups 'NIV-indication' and ŉo
  NIV-indication yet' patients at the first HVS visit: 259 ($±$92) vs. 348 ($±$137)
  L/min, p = 0.019. PCF and SNIP showed the best predictive characteristics in terms
  of sensitivity. CONCLUSION: SNIP showed the greatest decline prior to NIV indication
  and PCF significantly differentiated 'NIV-indication' from ŉo NIV-indication yet'
  patients with ALS. Currently used cut-off values might be adjusted and other respiratory
  function tests such as SNIP and PCF may become part of routine care in patients
  with ALS in order to avoid non-timely initiation of (non-invasive) ventilation."
