abstract: Centronuclear myopathy (CNM) is a heterogeneous group of muscle disorders
  primarily characterized by muscle weakness and variable degrees of respiratory dysfunction
  caused by mutations in MTM1, DNM2, RYR1, TTN and BIN1. X-linked myotubular myopathy
  has been the focus of recent natural history studies and clinical trials. Data on
  respiratory function for other genotypes is limited. To better understand the respiratory
  properties of the CNM spectrum, we performed a retrospective study in a non-selective
  Dutch CNM cohort. Respiratory dysfunction was defined as an FVC below 70% of predicted
  and/or a daytime pCO2 higher than 6 kPa. We collected results of other pulmonary
  function values (FEV1/FVC ratio) and treatment data from the home mechanical ventilation
  centres. Sixty-one CNM patients were included. Symptoms of respiratory weakness
  were reported by 15/47 (32%) patients. Thirty-three individuals (54%) with different
  genotypes except autosomal dominant (AD)-BIN1-related CNM showed respiratory dysfunction.
  Spirometry showed decreased FVC, FEV1 & PEF values in all but two patients. Sixteen
  patients were using HMV (26%), thirteen of them only during night-time. In conclusion,
  this study provides insight into the prevalence of respiratory symptoms in four
  genetic forms of CNM in the Netherlands and offers the basis for future natural
  history studies.
