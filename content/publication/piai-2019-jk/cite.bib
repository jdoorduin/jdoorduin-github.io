 abstract = {OBJECTIVE: We report the case of a professional violin player
who underwent an awake craniotomy to resect a tumor in the left
supplementary motor area, an area involved in motor planning.
METHOD: A careful pre- and intraoperative monitoring plan for
music performance and complex motor function was established
that could be used in combination with cortical stimulation.
RESULTS: The patient suffered an epileptic seizure during
cortical stimulation. The monitoring of complex motor and
musical functions was implemented with the patient playing the
violin while the resection was performed. Almost complete
resection was achieved with no notable postoperative deficits
contributing to functional impairment. CONCLUSIONS: The
multidisciplinary approach, involving neurosurgery,
neuropsychology, anesthesiology, and clinical neurophysiology,
allowed us to successfully cope with the theoretical and
practical challenges associated with tailored care for a
professional musician. The music and motor monitoring plan is
reported in detail to enable other sites to reproduce and adapt
it accordingly.},
