abstract: 'OBJECTIVE: We report the case of a professional violin player who underwent
  an awake craniotomy to resect a tumor in the left supplementary motor area, an area
  involved in motor planning. METHOD: A careful pre- and intraoperative monitoring
  plan for music performance and complex motor function was established that could
  be used in combination with cortical stimulation. RESULTS: The patient suffered
  an epileptic seizure during cortical stimulation. The monitoring of complex motor
  and musical functions was implemented with the patient playing the violin while
  the resection was performed. Almost complete resection was achieved with no notable
  postoperative deficits contributing to functional impairment. CONCLUSIONS: The multidisciplinary
  approach, involving neurosurgery, neuropsychology, anesthesiology, and clinical
  neurophysiology, allowed us to successfully cope with the theoretical and practical
  challenges associated with tailored care for a professional musician. The music
  and motor monitoring plan is reported in detail to enable other sites to reproduce
  and adapt it accordingly.'
