 abstract = {BACKGROUND: SELENON(SEPN1)-related myopathy (SELENON-RM) is a
rare congenital neuromuscular disease characterized by proximal
and axial muscle weakness, spinal rigidity, scoliosis and
respiratory impairment. No curative treatment options exist, but
promising preclinical studies are ongoing. Currently, natural
history data are lacking, while selection of appropriate
clinical and functional outcome measures is needed to reach
trial readiness. OBJECTIVE: We aim to identify all Dutch and
Dutch-speaking Belgian SELENON-RM patients, deep clinical
phenotyping, trial readiness and optimization of clinical care.
METHODS: This cross-sectional, single-center, observational
study comprised neurological examination, functional
measurements including Motor Function Measurement 20/32
(MFM-20/32) and accelerometry, questionnaires, muscle
ultrasound, respiratory function tests, electro- and
echocardiography, and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. RESULTS:
Eleven patients with genetically confirmed SELENON-RM were
included (20$±$13 (3-42) years, 73% male). Axial and proximal
muscle weakness were most pronounced. The mean MFM-20/32 score
was 71.2$±$15.1%, with domain 1 (standing and transfers)
being most severely affected. Accelerometry showed a strong
correlation with MFM-20/32. Questionnaires revealed impaired
quality of life, pain and problematic fatigue. Muscle ultrasound
showed symmetrically increased echogenicity in all muscles.
Respiratory function, and particularly diaphragm function, was
impaired in all patients, irrespective of the age. Cardiac
assessment showed normal left ventricular systolic function in
all patients but abnormal left ventricular global longitudinal
strain in 43% of patients and QRS fragmentation in 80%.
Further, 80% of patients showed decreased bone mineral density
on dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scan and 55% of patients
retrospectively experienced fragility long bone fractures.
CONCLUSIONS: We recommend cardiorespiratory follow-up as a part
of routine clinical care in all patients. Furthermore, we advise
vitamin D supplementation and optimization of calcium intake to
improve bone quality. We recommend management interventions to
reduce pain and fatigue. For future clinical trials, we propose
MFM-20/32, accelerometry and muscle ultrasound to capture
disease severity and possibly disease progression.},
