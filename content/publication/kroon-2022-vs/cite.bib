 abstract = {INTRODUCTION/AIMS: Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD) is
a late-onset, progressive muscle disease. Quantitative muscle
ultrasound (QMUS) assesses structural changes in muscles and is
a sensitive biomarker in neuromuscular disorders. Our aim of
this study was to determine whether QMUS can detect muscle
pathology and can be used as longitudinal imaging biomarker in
OPMD. METHODS: Genetically confirmed OPMD patients, recruited by
their treating physicians or from the national neuromuscular
database, were examined twice, 20 months apart, using QMUS of
orofacial and limb muscles, and measurements of functional
capacity and muscle strength. Absolute echo intensity (AEI) and
muscle thickness of all muscles were analyzed and correlated
with clinical data. RESULTS: The tongue, deltoid, iliopsoas,
rectus femoris, and soleus muscles showed increased AEI at
baseline compared with normal values in 43 OPMD patients, with
the rectus femoris being most often affected (51%).The AEI and
muscle thickness of 9 of 11 muscles correlated significantly
with the motor function measure, 10-step stair test, swallowing
capacity, dynamometry, Medical Research Council grade, tongue
strength, and bite force (r = 0.302 to -0.711). Between baseline
and follow-up, deterioration in AEI was found for the
temporalis, tongue, and deltoid muscles, and decreased muscle
thickness was detected for the temporalis, masseter, digastric,
tongue, deltoid, iliopsoas, and soleus muscles (P < .05). No
relation was found between the change in AEI and repeat length
or disease duration. DISCUSSION: QMUS detected muscle pathology
and disease progression in OPMD over 20 months. We conclude that
QMUS should be considered as a biomarker in treatment trials.},
