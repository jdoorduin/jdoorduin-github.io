abstract: 'INTRODUCTION/AIMS: Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD) is a late-onset,
  progressive muscle disease. Quantitative muscle ultrasound (QMUS) assesses structural
  changes in muscles and is a sensitive biomarker in neuromuscular disorders. Our
  aim of this study was to determine whether QMUS can detect muscle pathology and
  can be used as longitudinal imaging biomarker in OPMD. METHODS: Genetically confirmed
  OPMD patients, recruited by their treating physicians or from the national neuromuscular
  database, were examined twice, 20 months apart, using QMUS of orofacial and limb
  muscles, and measurements of functional capacity and muscle strength. Absolute echo
  intensity (AEI) and muscle thickness of all muscles were analyzed and correlated
  with clinical data. RESULTS: The tongue, deltoid, iliopsoas, rectus femoris, and
  soleus muscles showed increased AEI at baseline compared with normal values in 43
  OPMD patients, with the rectus femoris being most often affected (51%).The AEI and
  muscle thickness of 9 of 11 muscles correlated significantly with the motor function
  measure, 10-step stair test, swallowing capacity, dynamometry, Medical Research
  Council grade, tongue strength, and bite force (r = 0.302 to -0.711). Between baseline
  and follow-up, deterioration in AEI was found for the temporalis, tongue, and deltoid
  muscles, and decreased muscle thickness was detected for the temporalis, masseter,
  digastric, tongue, deltoid, iliopsoas, and soleus muscles (P < .05). No relation
  was found between the change in AEI and repeat length or disease duration. DISCUSSION:
  QMUS detected muscle pathology and disease progression in OPMD over 20 months. We
  conclude that QMUS should be considered as a biomarker in treatment trials.'
