abstract: 'PURPOSE: Respiratory muscle weakness frequently develops in critically
  ill patients and is associated with adverse outcome, including difficult weaning
  from mechanical ventilation. Today, no drug is approved to improve respiratory muscle
  function in these patients. Previously, we have shown that the calcium sensitizer
  levosimendan improves calcium sensitivity of human diaphragm muscle fibers in vitro
  and contractile efficiency of the diaphragm in healthy subjects. The main purpose
  of this study is to investigate the effects of levosimendan on diaphragm contractile
  efficiency in mechanically ventilated patients. METHODS: In a double-blind randomized
  placebo-controlled trial, mechanically ventilated patients performed two 30-min
  continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) trials with 5-h interval. After the first
  CPAP trial, study medication (levosimendan 0.2 Âµg/kg/min continuous infusion or
  placebo) was administered. During the CPAP trials, electrical activity of the diaphragm
  (EAdi), transdiaphragmatic pressure (Pdi), and flow were measured. Neuromechanical
  efficiency (primary outcome parameter) was calculated. RESULTS: Thirty-nine patients
  were included in the study. Neuromechanical efficiency was not different during
  the CPAP trial after levosimendan administration compared to the CPAP trial before
  study medication. Tidal volume and minute ventilation were higher after levosimendan
  administration (11 and 21%, respectively), whereas EAdi and Pdi were higher in both
  groups in the CPAP trial after study medication compared to the CPAP trial before
  study medication. CONCLUSIONS: Levosimendan does not improve diaphragm contractile
  efficiency.'
