 abstract = {PURPOSE: Respiratory muscle weakness frequently develops in
critically ill patients and is associated with adverse outcome,
including difficult weaning from mechanical ventilation. Today,
no drug is approved to improve respiratory muscle function in
these patients. Previously, we have shown that the calcium
sensitizer levosimendan improves calcium sensitivity of human
diaphragm muscle fibers in vitro and contractile efficiency of
the diaphragm in healthy subjects. The main purpose of this
study is to investigate the effects of levosimendan on diaphragm
contractile efficiency in mechanically ventilated patients.
METHODS: In a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial,
mechanically ventilated patients performed two 30-min continuous
positive airway pressure (CPAP) trials with 5-h interval. After
the first CPAP trial, study medication (levosimendan 0.2
Âµg/kg/min continuous infusion or placebo) was administered.
During the CPAP trials, electrical activity of the diaphragm
(EAdi), transdiaphragmatic pressure (Pdi), and flow were
measured. Neuromechanical efficiency (primary outcome parameter)
was calculated. RESULTS: Thirty-nine patients were included in
the study. Neuromechanical efficiency was not different during
the CPAP trial after levosimendan administration compared to the
CPAP trial before study medication. Tidal volume and minute
ventilation were higher after levosimendan administration (11
and 21%, respectively), whereas EAdi and Pdi were higher in
both groups in the CPAP trial after study medication compared to
the CPAP trial before study medication. CONCLUSIONS:
Levosimendan does not improve diaphragm contractile efficiency.},
