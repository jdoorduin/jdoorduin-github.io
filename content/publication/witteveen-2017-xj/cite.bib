 abstract = {BACKGROUND: Neuromuscular ultrasound is a noninvasive
investigation, which can be easily performed at the bedside on
the ICU. A reduction in muscle thickness and increase in echo
intensity over time have been described in ICU patients, but the
relation to ICU-acquired weakness (ICU-AW) is unknown. We
hypothesized that quantitative assessment of muscle and nerve
parameters with ultrasound can differentiate between patients
with and without ICU-AW. The aim of this cross-sectional study
was to investigate the diagnostic accuracy of neuromuscular
ultrasound for diagnosing ICU-AW. METHODS: Newly admitted ICU
patients, mechanically ventilated for at least 48 h, were
included. As soon as patients were awake and attentive, an
ultrasound was made of four muscles and two nerves (index test)
and ICU-AW was evaluated using muscle strength testing
(reference standard; ICU-AW defined as mean Medical Research
Council score <4). Diagnostic accuracy of muscle thickness, echo
intensity and homogeneity (echo intensity standard deviation) as
well as nerve cross-sectional area, thickness and
vascularization were evaluated with the area under the curve of
the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC-AUC). We also
evaluated diagnostic accuracy of z-scores of muscle thickness,
echo intensity and echo intensity standard deviation. RESULTS:
Seventy-one patients were evaluated of whom 41 had ICU-AW.
Ultrasound was done at a median of 7 days after admission in
patients without ICU-AW and 9 days in patients with ICU-AW.
Diagnostic accuracy of all muscle and nerve parameters was low.
ROC-AUC ranged from 51.3 to 68.0% for muscle parameters and
from 51.0 to 66.7% for nerve parameters. CONCLUSION:
Neuromuscular ultrasound does not discriminate between patients
with and without ICU-AW at the time the patient awakens and is
therefore not able to reliably diagnose ICU-AW in ICU patients
relatively early in the disease course.},
