abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Neuromuscular ultrasound is a noninvasive investigation, which
  can be easily performed at the bedside on the ICU. A reduction in muscle thickness
  and increase in echo intensity over time have been described in ICU patients, but
  the relation to ICU-acquired weakness (ICU-AW) is unknown. We hypothesized that
  quantitative assessment of muscle and nerve parameters with ultrasound can differentiate
  between patients with and without ICU-AW. The aim of this cross-sectional study
  was to investigate the diagnostic accuracy of neuromuscular ultrasound for diagnosing
  ICU-AW. METHODS: Newly admitted ICU patients, mechanically ventilated for at least
  48 h, were included. As soon as patients were awake and attentive, an ultrasound
  was made of four muscles and two nerves (index test) and ICU-AW was evaluated using
  muscle strength testing (reference standard; ICU-AW defined as mean Medical Research
  Council score <4). Diagnostic accuracy of muscle thickness, echo intensity and homogeneity
  (echo intensity standard deviation) as well as nerve cross-sectional area, thickness
  and vascularization were evaluated with the area under the curve of the receiver
  operating characteristic curve (ROC-AUC). We also evaluated diagnostic accuracy
  of z-scores of muscle thickness, echo intensity and echo intensity standard deviation.
  RESULTS: Seventy-one patients were evaluated of whom 41 had ICU-AW. Ultrasound was
  done at a median of 7 days after admission in patients without ICU-AW and 9 days
  in patients with ICU-AW. Diagnostic accuracy of all muscle and nerve parameters
  was low. ROC-AUC ranged from 51.3 to 68.0% for muscle parameters and from 51.0 to
  66.7% for nerve parameters. CONCLUSION: Neuromuscular ultrasound does not discriminate
  between patients with and without ICU-AW at the time the patient awakens and is
  therefore not able to reliably diagnose ICU-AW in ICU patients relatively early
  in the disease course.'
