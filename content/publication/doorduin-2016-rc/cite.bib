 abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: In this review, we discuss the causes for a
failed weaning trial and specific diagnostic tests that could be
conducted to identify the cause for weaning failure. We briefly
highlight treatment strategies that may enhance the chance of
weaning success. RECENT FINDINGS: Impaired respiratory
mechanics, respiratory muscle dysfunction, cardiac dysfunction,
cognitive dysfunction, and metabolic disorders are recognized
causes for weaning failure. In addition, iatrogenic factors may
be at play. Most studies have focused on respiratory muscle
dysfunction and cardiac dysfunction. Recent studies demonstrate
that both ultrasound and electromyography are valuable tools to
evaluate respiratory muscle function in ventilated patients.
Sophisticated ultrasound techniques and biomarkers such as
B-type natriuretic peptide, are valuable tools to identify
cardiac dysfunction as a cause for weaning failure. Once a cause
for weaning failure has been identified specific treatment
should be instituted. Concerning treatment, both strength
training and endurance training should be considered for
patients with respiratory muscle weakness. Inotropes and
vasodilators should be considered in case of heart failure.
SUMMARY: Understanding the complex pathophysiology of weaning
failure in combination with a systematic diagnostic approach
allows identification of the primary cause of weaning failure.
This will help the clinician to choose a specific treatment
strategy and therefore may fasten liberation from mechanical
ventilation.},
