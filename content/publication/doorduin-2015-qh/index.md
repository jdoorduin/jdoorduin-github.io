abstract: 'INTRODUCTION: Systemic inflammation is a well-known risk factor for respiratory
  muscle weakness. Studies using animal models of inflammation have shown that endotoxin
  administration induces diaphragm dysfunction. However, the effects of in vivo endotoxin
  administration on diaphragm function in humans have not been studied. Our aim was
  to evaluate diaphragm function in a model of systemic inflammation in healthy subjects.
  METHODS: Two groups of 12 male volunteers received an intravenous bolus of 2 ng/kg
  of Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and were monitored until 8 h after
  LPS administration. In the first group, the twitch transdiaphragmatic pressure (Pditw)
  and compound muscle action potential of the diaphragm (CMAPdi) were measured. In
  addition, plasma levels of cytokines, heart rate, and arterial blood pressure were
  measured. In the second group, catecholamines as well as respiratory rate and blood
  gas values were measured. Diaphragm ultrasonography was performed in four subjects
  with severe shivering. RESULTS: Lipopolysaccharide administration resulted in flulike
  symptoms, hemodynamic alterations, and increased plasma levels of cytokines. The
  Pditw increased after LPS administration from 31.2 $±$ 2.0 cmH2O (baseline) to 38.8
  $±$ 2.0 cmH2O (t = 1 h) and 35.4 $±$ 2.0 cmH2O (t = 1.5 h). There was no correlation
  between cytokine plasma levels and the Pditw. We found a trend toward a gradual
  decrease in the CMAPdi from 0.78 $±$ 0.07 mV (baseline) to 0.58 $±$ 0.05 mV (t =
  2 h). Respiratory rate increased after LPS administration from 16.8 $±$ 0.5 breaths/min
  (baseline) to 20.3 $±$ 0.6 breaths/min (t = 4 h), with a resulting decrease in PaCO2
  of 0.5 $±$ 0.1 kPa. Plasma levels of epinephrine peaked at t = 1.5 h, with an increase
  of 1.3 $±$ 0.3 nmol/L from baseline. Rapid diaphragm contractions consistent with
  shivering were observed. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that, in contrast to diaphragm
  dysfunction observed in animal models of inflammation, in vivo diaphragm contractility
  is augmented in the early phase after low-dose endotoxin administration in humans.'
