 abstract = {BACKGROUND: Dynamic pulmonary hyperinflation may develop in
patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) due
to dynamic airway collapse and/or increased airway resistance,
increasing the risk of volutrauma and hemodynamic compromise.
The reference standard to quantify dynamic pulmonary
hyperinflation is the measurement of the volume at
end-inspiration (Vei). As this is cumbersome, the aim of this
study was to evaluate if methods that are easier to perform at
the bedside can accurately reflect Vei. METHODS: Vei was
assessed in COPD patients under controlled protective mechanical
ventilation (7 $±$ mL/kg) on zero end-expiratory pressure,
using three techniques in a fixed order: (1) reference standard
(Veireference): passive exhalation to atmosphere from
end-inspiration in a calibrated glass burette; (2) ventilator
maneuver (Veimaneuver): measuring the expired volume during a
passive exhalation of 45s using the ventilator flow sensor; (3)
formula (Veiformula): (Vt $\times$ Pplateau)/(Pplateau - PEEPi),
with Vt tidal volume, Pplateau is plateau pressure after an
end-inspiratory occlusion, and PEEPi is intrinsic positive
end-expiratory pressure after an end-expiratory occlusion. A
convenience sample of 17 patients was recruited. RESULTS:
Veireference was 1030 $±$ 380 mL and had no significant
correlation with Pplateau (r2 = 0.06; P = 0.3710) or PEEPi (r2 =
0.11; P = 0.2156), and was inversely related with Pdrive
(calculated as Pplateau -PEEPi) (r2 = 0.49; P = 0.0024). A low
bias but rather wide limits of agreement and fairly good
correlations were found when comparing Veimaneuver and
Veiformula to Veireference. Vei remained stable during the study
period (low bias 15 mL with high agreement (95% limits of
agreement from - 100 to 130 mL) and high correlation (r2 = 0.98;
P < 0.0001) between both measurements of Veireference).
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with COPD, airway pressures are not a
valid representation of Vei. The three techniques to quantify
Vei show low bias, but wide limits of agreement.},
