abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Dynamic pulmonary hyperinflation may develop in patients with
  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) due to dynamic airway collapse and/or
  increased airway resistance, increasing the risk of volutrauma and hemodynamic compromise.
  The reference standard to quantify dynamic pulmonary hyperinflation is the measurement
  of the volume at end-inspiration (Vei). As this is cumbersome, the aim of this study
  was to evaluate if methods that are easier to perform at the bedside can accurately
  reflect Vei. METHODS: Vei was assessed in COPD patients under controlled protective
  mechanical ventilation (7 $±$ mL/kg) on zero end-expiratory pressure, using three
  techniques in a fixed order: (1) reference standard (Veireference): passive exhalation
  to atmosphere from end-inspiration in a calibrated glass burette; (2) ventilator
  maneuver (Veimaneuver): measuring the expired volume during a passive exhalation
  of 45s using the ventilator flow sensor; (3) formula (Veiformula): (Vt $times$ Pplateau)/(Pplateau
  - PEEPi), with Vt tidal volume, Pplateau is plateau pressure after an end-inspiratory
  occlusion, and PEEPi is intrinsic positive end-expiratory pressure after an end-expiratory
  occlusion. A convenience sample of 17 patients was recruited. RESULTS: Veireference
  was 1030 $±$ 380 mL and had no significant correlation with Pplateau (r2 = 0.06;
  P = 0.3710) or PEEPi (r2 = 0.11; P = 0.2156), and was inversely related with Pdrive
  (calculated as Pplateau -PEEPi) (r2 = 0.49; P = 0.0024). A low bias but rather wide
  limits of agreement and fairly good correlations were found when comparing Veimaneuver
  and Veiformula to Veireference. Vei remained stable during the study period (low
  bias 15 mL with high agreement (95% limits of agreement from - 100 to 130 mL) and
  high correlation (r2 = 0.98; P < 0.0001) between both measurements of Veireference).
  CONCLUSIONS: In patients with COPD, airway pressures are not a valid representation
  of Vei. The three techniques to quantify Vei show low bias, but wide limits of agreement.'
