abstract: 'INTRODUCTION/AIMS: Needle electromyography (EMG) and muscle ultrasound
  can be used to evaluate patients with suspected neuromuscular disorders. The relation
  between muscle ultrasound pathology and the corresponding needle EMG findings is
  unknown. In this study we compared the results of concurrent ultrasound and needle
  EMG examinations in patients suspected of a neuromuscular disorder. METHODS: Retrospective
  data from 218 patients with pairwise ultrasound and EMG results of 796 muscles were
  analyzed. We compared overall quantitative and visual muscle ultrasound results
  to EMGs with neurogenic and myopathic abnormalities and assessed the congruency
  of both methods in the different clinical diagnosis categories. RESULTS: In muscles
  of patients with a neuromuscular disorder, abnormalities were found with EMG in
  71.8%, and quantitative and visual muscle ultrasound results were abnormal in 19.3%
  and 35.4% respectively. In muscles with neurogenic EMG abnormalities, quantitative
  and visual muscle ultrasound results were abnormal in 18.9% versus 35.6%, increasing
  up to 43.7% versus 87.5% in muscles with the most pronounced signs of denervation.
  Congruency of EMG and ultrasound was better for more proximal and cranial muscles
  than for muscles in the hand and lower limb. DISCUSSION: Needle EMG and muscle ultrasound
  typically produce disparate results and identify different aspects of muscle pathology.
  Muscle ultrasound seems less suited for detecting mild neurogenic abnormalities.
  As the severity of neurogenic needle EMG abnormalities increased, muscle ultrasound
  abnormalities were also increasingly found. Visual analysis seems better suited
  than grayscale quantification for detecting neurogenic abnormalities.'
