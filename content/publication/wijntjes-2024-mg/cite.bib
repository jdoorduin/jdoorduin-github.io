 abstract = {INTRODUCTION/AIMS: Needle electromyography (EMG) and muscle
ultrasound can be used to evaluate patients with suspected
neuromuscular disorders. The relation between muscle ultrasound
pathology and the corresponding needle EMG findings is unknown.
In this study we compared the results of concurrent ultrasound
and needle EMG examinations in patients suspected of a
neuromuscular disorder. METHODS: Retrospective data from 218
patients with pairwise ultrasound and EMG results of 796 muscles
were analyzed. We compared overall quantitative and visual
muscle ultrasound results to EMGs with neurogenic and myopathic
abnormalities and assessed the congruency of both methods in the
different clinical diagnosis categories. RESULTS: In muscles of
patients with a neuromuscular disorder, abnormalities were found
with EMG in 71.8%, and quantitative and visual muscle
ultrasound results were abnormal in 19.3% and 35.4%
respectively. In muscles with neurogenic EMG abnormalities,
quantitative and visual muscle ultrasound results were abnormal
in 18.9% versus 35.6%, increasing up to 43.7% versus 87.5%
in muscles with the most pronounced signs of denervation.
Congruency of EMG and ultrasound was better for more proximal
and cranial muscles than for muscles in the hand and lower limb.
DISCUSSION: Needle EMG and muscle ultrasound typically produce
disparate results and identify different aspects of muscle
pathology. Muscle ultrasound seems less suited for detecting
mild neurogenic abnormalities. As the severity of neurogenic
needle EMG abnormalities increased, muscle ultrasound
abnormalities were also increasingly found. Visual analysis
seems better suited than grayscale quantification for detecting
neurogenic abnormalities.},
