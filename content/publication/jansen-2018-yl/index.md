abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Diaphragm dysfunction develops frequently in ventilated intensive
  care unit (ICU) patients. Both disuse atrophy (ventilator over-assist) and high
  respiratory muscle effort (ventilator under-assist) seem to be involved. A strong
  rationale exists to monitor diaphragm effort and titrate support to maintain respiratory
  muscle activity within physiological limits. Diaphragm electromyography is used
  to quantify breathing effort and has been correlated with transdiaphragmatic pressure
  and esophageal pressure. The neuromuscular efficiency index (NME) can be used to
  estimate inspiratory effort, however its repeatability has not been investigated
  yet. Our goal is to evaluate NME repeatability during an end-expiratory occlusion
  (NMEoccl) and its use to estimate the pressure generated by the inspiratory muscles
  (Pmus). METHODS: This is a prospective cohort study, performed in a medical-surgical
  ICU. A total of 31 adult patients were included, all ventilated in neurally adjusted
  ventilator assist (NAVA) mode with an electrical activity of the diaphragm (EAdi)
  catheter in situ. At four time points within 72 h five repeated end-expiratory occlusion
  maneuvers were performed. NMEoccl was calculated by delta airway pressure ($Δ$Paw)/$Δ$EAdi
  and was used to estimate Pmus. The repeatability coefficient (RC) was calculated
  to investigate the NMEoccl variability. RESULTS: A total number of 459 maneuvers
  were obtained. At time T = 0 mean NMEoccl was 1.22 $±$ 0.86 cmH2O/$μ$V with a RC
  of 82.6%. This implies that when NMEoccl is 1.22 cmH2O/$μ$V, it is expected with
  a probability of 95% that the subsequent measured NMEoccl will be between 2.22 and
  0.22 cmH2O/$μ$V. Additional EAdi waveform analysis to correct for non-physiological
  appearing waveforms, did not improve NMEoccl variability. Selecting three out of
  five occlusions with the lowest variability reduced the RC to 29.8%. CONCLUSIONS:
  Repeated measurements of NMEoccl exhibit high variability, limiting the ability
  of a single NMEoccl maneuver to estimate neuromuscular efficiency and therefore
  the pressure generated by the inspiratory muscles based on EAdi.'
