abstract: Assessment of diaphragmatic effort is challenging, especially in critically
  ill patients in the phase of weaning. Fractional thickening during inspiration assessed
  by ultrasound has been used to estimate diaphragm effort. It is unknown whether
  more sophisticated ultrasound techniques such as speckle tracking are superior in
  the quantification of inspiratory effort. This study evaluates the validity of speckle
  tracking ultrasound to quantify diaphragm contractility. Thirteen healthy volunteers
  underwent a randomized stepwise threshold loading protocol of 0-50% of the maximal
  inspiratory pressure. Electric activity of the diaphragm and transdiaphragmatic
  pressures were recorded. Speckle tracking ultrasound was used to assess strain and
  strain rate as measures of diaphragm tissue deformation and deformation velocity,
  respectively. Fractional thickening was assessed by measurement of diaphragm thickness
  at end-inspiration and end-expiration. Strain and strain rate increased with progressive
  loading of the diaphragm. Both strain and strain rate were highly correlated to
  transdiaphragmatic pressure (strain r2 = 0.72; strain rate r2 = 0.80) and diaphragm
  electric activity (strain r2 = 0.60; strain rate r2 = 0.66). We conclude that speckle
  tracking ultrasound is superior to conventional ultrasound techniques to estimate
  diaphragm contractility under inspiratory threshold loading.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Transdiaphragmatic
  pressure using esophageal and gastric balloons is the gold standard to assess diaphragm
  effort. However, this technique is invasive and requires expertise, and the interpretation
  may be complex. We report that speckle tracking ultrasound can be used to detect
  stepwise increases in diaphragmatic effort. Strain and strain rate were highly correlated
  with transdiaphragmatic pressure, and therefore, diaphragm electric activity and
  speckle tracking might serve as reliable tools to quantify diaphragm effort in the
  future.
