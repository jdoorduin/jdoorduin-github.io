abstract: Impaired muscle relaxation is a notable feature in specific myopathies.
  Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the motor cortex can induce muscle relaxation
  by abruptly halting corticospinal drive. Our aim was to quantify muscle relaxation
  using TMS in different myopathies with symptoms of muscle stiffness, contractures/cramps,
  and myalgia and explore the technique's diagnostic potential. In men, normalized
  peak relaxation rate was lower in Brody disease (n = 4) (-3.5 $±$ 1.3 s-1), nemaline
  myopathy type 6 (NEM6; n = 5) (-7.5 $±$ 1.0 s-1), and myotonic dystrophy type 2
  (DM2; n = 5) (-10.2 $±$ 2.0 s-1) compared to healthy (n = 14) (-13.7 $±$ 2.1 s-1;
  all P $łeq$ 0.01) and symptomatic controls (n = 9) (-13.7 $±$ 1.6 s-1; all P $łeq$
  0.02). In women, NEM6 (n = 5) (-5.7 $±$ 2.1 s-1) and McArdle patients (n = 4) (-6.6
  $±$ 1.4 s-1) had lower relaxation rate compared to healthy (n = 10) (-11.7 $±$ 1.6
  s-1; both P $łeq$ 0.002) and symptomatic controls (n = 8) (-11.3 $±$ 1.8 s-1; both
  P $łeq$ 0.008). TMS-induced muscle relaxation achieved a high level of diagnostic
  accuracy (area under the curve = 0.94 (M) and 0.92 (F)) to differentiate symptomatic
  controls from myopathy patients. Muscle relaxation assessed using TMS has the potential
  to serve as a diagnostic tool, an in-vivo functional test to confirm the pathogenicity
  of unknown variants, an outcome measure in clinical trials, and monitor disease
  progression.
