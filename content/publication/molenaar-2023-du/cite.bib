 abstract = {Impaired muscle relaxation is a notable feature in specific
myopathies. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the motor
cortex can induce muscle relaxation by abruptly halting
corticospinal drive. Our aim was to quantify muscle relaxation
using TMS in different myopathies with symptoms of muscle
stiffness, contractures/cramps, and myalgia and explore the
technique's diagnostic potential. In men, normalized peak
relaxation rate was lower in Brody disease (n = 4) (-3.5 $±$
1.3 s-1), nemaline myopathy type 6 (NEM6; n = 5) (-7.5 $±$ 1.0
s-1), and myotonic dystrophy type 2 (DM2; n = 5) (-10.2 $±$
2.0 s-1) compared to healthy (n = 14) (-13.7 $±$ 2.1 s-1; all
P $łeq$ 0.01) and symptomatic controls (n = 9) (-13.7 $±$ 1.6
s-1; all P $łeq$ 0.02). In women, NEM6 (n = 5) (-5.7 $±$ 2.1
s-1) and McArdle patients (n = 4) (-6.6 $±$ 1.4 s-1) had lower
relaxation rate compared to healthy (n = 10) (-11.7 $±$ 1.6
s-1; both P $łeq$ 0.002) and symptomatic controls (n = 8)
(-11.3 $±$ 1.8 s-1; both P $łeq$ 0.008). TMS-induced muscle
relaxation achieved a high level of diagnostic accuracy (area
under the curve = 0.94 (M) and 0.92 (F)) to differentiate
symptomatic controls from myopathy patients. Muscle relaxation
assessed using TMS has the potential to serve as a diagnostic
tool, an in-vivo functional test to confirm the pathogenicity of
unknown variants, an outcome measure in clinical trials, and
monitor disease progression.},
