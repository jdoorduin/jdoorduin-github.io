abstract: 'OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the 5-year change in respiratory function in patients
  with facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD). METHODS: Genetically confirmed
  patients with FSHD aged $≥$ 18 years were examined twice over five years. Forced
  vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) were measured using
  hand-held spirometry with a face mask. Several clinical outcome measures were correlated
  to respiratory function. RESULTS: Ninety-two patients were included (57% male, age
  18-75 years). At baseline, the spirometry outcomes of 41 patients showed a restrictive
  ventilatory pattern (FVC 10% predicted. The subgroup of 15 patients was more severely
  affected at baseline (p = 0.002 for FSHD clinical score and 0.007 for Ricci score).
  They developed more frequently spinal and thorax deformities (p < 0.001 for kyphoscoliosis
  and 0.012 for pectus excavatum) and had a larger decline in axial muscle function
  (p = 0.020). Only weak correlations were found between the change in FVC% predicted
  and the change in clinical scores between baseline and follow-up. INTERPRETATION:
  Respiratory function remained stable in most patients with FSHD, but a subgroup
  of patients showed a pronounced deterioration. They showed more severe muscle weakness
  including the leg muscles at baseline (Ricci score $≥$ 6), had spinal and thorax
  deformities and a relatively fast decline in axial muscle function at follow-up.'
