 abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the 5-year change in respiratory function
in patients with facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD).
METHODS: Genetically confirmed patients with FSHD aged $≥$ 18
years were examined twice over five years. Forced vital capacity
(FVC) and forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) were measured
using hand-held spirometry with a face mask. Several clinical
outcome measures were correlated to respiratory function.
RESULTS: Ninety-two patients were included (57% male, age 18-75
years). At baseline, the spirometry outcomes of 41 patients
showed a restrictive ventilatory pattern (FVC 10% predicted.
The subgroup of 15 patients was more severely affected at
baseline (p = 0.002 for FSHD clinical score and 0.007 for Ricci
score). They developed more frequently spinal and thorax
deformities (p < 0.001 for kyphoscoliosis and 0.012 for pectus
excavatum) and had a larger decline in axial muscle function (p
= 0.020). Only weak correlations were found between the change
in FVC% predicted and the change in clinical scores between
baseline and follow-up. INTERPRETATION: Respiratory function
remained stable in most patients with FSHD, but a subgroup of
patients showed a pronounced deterioration. They showed more
severe muscle weakness including the leg muscles at baseline
(Ricci score $≥$ 6), had spinal and thorax deformities and a
relatively fast decline in axial muscle function at follow-up.},
