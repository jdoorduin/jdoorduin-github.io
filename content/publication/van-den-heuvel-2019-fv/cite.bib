 abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Oxaliplatin-induced neurotoxicity can be a
dose-limiting side effect to effective chemotherapy. Acute
hyperexcitability causes cold-evoked sensory and motor symptoms,
which resemble neuromyotonia. An accessible and non-invasive
technique for early detection could help select patients for
potential treatments. We assessed the use of a simple surface
electromyography (sEMG) in patients directly after oxaliplatin
infusion. METHODS: In patients with colorectal cancer, acute
neurotoxicity was evaluated by means of a physical examination,
a questionnaire, and sEMG directly after the second and fourth
cycle of oxaliplatin. Questionnaires were also assessed 1 day
after infusion. RESULTS: 14 patients were measured after the
second cycle and 8 patients were also measured after the fourth
cycle of oxaliplatin. All patients reported to a variable degree
oxaliplatin induced neurotoxicity symptoms: sensitivity to
touching cold or swallowing cold items were reported as most
severe. Clinical signs of hyperexcitability were observed in
55% of the measurements. Spontaneous activity compatible with
neuromyotonia was observed in 82% of the sEMG recordings.
CONCLUSIONS: Patient reported symptoms, physical examination and
simple sEMG are complementary measurements to detect acute
oxaliplatin induced neurotoxicity. After further validation,
sEMG recording can be used as a simple objective screenings tool
to detect nerve hyperexcitability directly after oxaliplatin
administration.},
