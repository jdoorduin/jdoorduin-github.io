 abstract = {The objective of this study was to assess ability to identify
asynchronies during noninvasive ventilation (NIV) through
ventilator waveforms according to experience and interface, and
to ascertain the influence of breathing pattern and respiratory
drive on sensitivity and prevalence of asynchronies. 35 expert
and 35 nonexpert physicians evaluated 40 5-min NIV reports
displaying flow-time and airway pressure-time tracings;
identified asynchronies were compared with those ascertained by
three examiners who evaluated the same reports displaying,
additionally, tracings of diaphragm electrical activity. We
determined: 1) sensitivity, specificity, and positive and
negative predictive values; 2) the correlation between the
double true index (DTI) of each report (i.e., the ratio between
the sum of true positives and true negatives, and the overall
breath count) and the corresponding asynchrony index (AI); and
3) the influence of breathing pattern and respiratory drive on
both AI and sensitivity. Sensitivities to detect asynchronies
were low either according to experience (0.20 (95% CI
0.14-0.29) for expert versus 0.21 (95% CI 0.12-0.30) for
nonexpert, p=0.837) or interface (0.28 (95% CI 0.17-0.37) for
mask versus 0.10 (95% CI 0.05-0.16) for helmet, p<0.0001). DTI
inversely correlated with the AI (r2=0.67, p<0.0001). Breathing
pattern and respiratory drive did not affect prevalence of
asynchronies and sensitivity. Patient-ventilator asynchrony
during NIV is difficult to recognise solely by visual inspection
of ventilator waveforms.},
