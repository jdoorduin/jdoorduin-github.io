abstract: 'The objective of this study was to assess ability to identify asynchronies
  during noninvasive ventilation (NIV) through ventilator waveforms according to experience
  and interface, and to ascertain the influence of breathing pattern and respiratory
  drive on sensitivity and prevalence of asynchronies. 35 expert and 35 nonexpert
  physicians evaluated 40 5-min NIV reports displaying flow-time and airway pressure-time
  tracings; identified asynchronies were compared with those ascertained by three
  examiners who evaluated the same reports displaying, additionally, tracings of diaphragm
  electrical activity. We determined: 1) sensitivity, specificity, and positive and
  negative predictive values; 2) the correlation between the double true index (DTI)
  of each report (i.e., the ratio between the sum of true positives and true negatives,
  and the overall breath count) and the corresponding asynchrony index (AI); and 3)
  the influence of breathing pattern and respiratory drive on both AI and sensitivity.
  Sensitivities to detect asynchronies were low either according to experience (0.20
  (95% CI 0.14-0.29) for expert versus 0.21 (95% CI 0.12-0.30) for nonexpert, p=0.837)
  or interface (0.28 (95% CI 0.17-0.37) for mask versus 0.10 (95% CI 0.05-0.16) for
  helmet, p<0.0001). DTI inversely correlated with the AI (r2=0.67, p<0.0001). Breathing
  pattern and respiratory drive did not affect prevalence of asynchronies and sensitivity.
  Patient-ventilator asynchrony during NIV is difficult to recognise solely by visual
  inspection of ventilator waveforms.'
