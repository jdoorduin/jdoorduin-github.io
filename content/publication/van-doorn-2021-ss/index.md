abstract: Respiratory muscle weakness is common in neuromuscular disorders (NMDs)
  and leads to significant respiratory difficulties. Therefore, reliable and easy
  assessment of respiratory muscle structure and function in NMDs is crucial. In the
  last decade, ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have emerged as promising
  imaging techniques to assess respiratory muscle structure and function. Respiratory
  muscle imaging directly measures the respiratory muscles and, in contrast to pulmonary
  function testing, is independent of patient effort. This makes respiratory muscle
  imaging suitable to use as a tool in clinical respiratory management and as an outcome
  parameter in upcoming drug trials for NMDs, particularly in children. In this narrative
  review, we discuss the latest studies and technological developments in imaging
  of the respiratory muscles by ultrasound and MRI, and its clinical application and
  limitations. We aim to increase understanding of respiratory muscle imaging and
  facilitate its use as an outcome measure in daily practice and clinical trials.
