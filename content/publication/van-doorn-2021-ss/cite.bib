 abstract = {Respiratory muscle weakness is common in neuromuscular disorders
(NMDs) and leads to significant respiratory difficulties.
Therefore, reliable and easy assessment of respiratory muscle
structure and function in NMDs is crucial. In the last decade,
ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have emerged as
promising imaging techniques to assess respiratory muscle
structure and function. Respiratory muscle imaging directly
measures the respiratory muscles and, in contrast to pulmonary
function testing, is independent of patient effort. This makes
respiratory muscle imaging suitable to use as a tool in clinical
respiratory management and as an outcome parameter in upcoming
drug trials for NMDs, particularly in children. In this
narrative review, we discuss the latest studies and
technological developments in imaging of the respiratory muscles
by ultrasound and MRI, and its clinical application and
limitations. We aim to increase understanding of respiratory
muscle imaging and facilitate its use as an outcome measure in
daily practice and clinical trials.},
