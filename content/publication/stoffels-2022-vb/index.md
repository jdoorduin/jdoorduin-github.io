abstract: Muscle weakness is a prominent symptom in post-acute sequelae of COVID-19
  (PASC). However, few studies have objectively and longitudinally assessed muscle
  strength after varying COVID-19 severity grades. This observational study aimed
  to explore the prevalence, determinants, and 1.5 years change of quadriceps muscle
  weakness in 98 patients discharged from COVID-19 hospitalization and in 50 patients
  with PASC following mild COVID-19. Isometric quadriceps maximal voluntary contraction
  (MVC) was assessed on a computerized dynamometer at three visits. Also, in a subgroup
  of 14 post-COVID-19 patients with quadriceps muscle weakness, muscle thickness and
  echo intensity were determined by muscle ultrasound of nine upper and lower extremity
  muscles. Muscle weakness was found in 59% of post-hospitalized patients and in 65%
  of those with PASC following mild COVID-19 at ~14 weeks after acute COVID-19. Whereas
  during ~1.5 years follow-up MVC modestly improved, muscle weakness prevalence remained
  unchanged. Hospital length of stay and diabetes mellitus were identified as possible
  predictors of muscle weakness following COVID-19 hospitalization. No predictors
  could be identified in those with PASC following mild COVID-19. Ultrasound outcomes
  revealed no large structural abnormalities. In conclusion, clinically relevant muscle
  weakness is common after COVID-19 and its long-term improvement is poor. Future
  studies with relevant control groups are warranted to confirm our data.
