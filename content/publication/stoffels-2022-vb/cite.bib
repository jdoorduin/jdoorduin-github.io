 abstract = {Muscle weakness is a prominent symptom in post-acute sequelae of
COVID-19 (PASC). However, few studies have objectively and
longitudinally assessed muscle strength after varying COVID-19
severity grades. This observational study aimed to explore the
prevalence, determinants, and 1.5 years change of quadriceps
muscle weakness in 98 patients discharged from COVID-19
hospitalization and in 50 patients with PASC following mild
COVID-19. Isometric quadriceps maximal voluntary contraction
(MVC) was assessed on a computerized dynamometer at three
visits. Also, in a subgroup of 14 post-COVID-19 patients with
quadriceps muscle weakness, muscle thickness and echo intensity
were determined by muscle ultrasound of nine upper and lower
extremity muscles. Muscle weakness was found in 59% of
post-hospitalized patients and in 65% of those with PASC
following mild COVID-19 at ~14 weeks after acute COVID-19.
Whereas during ~1.5 years follow-up MVC modestly improved,
muscle weakness prevalence remained unchanged. Hospital length
of stay and diabetes mellitus were identified as possible
predictors of muscle weakness following COVID-19
hospitalization. No predictors could be identified in those with
PASC following mild COVID-19. Ultrasound outcomes revealed no
large structural abnormalities. In conclusion, clinically
relevant muscle weakness is common after COVID-19 and its
long-term improvement is poor. Future studies with relevant
control groups are warranted to confirm our data.},
