abstract: We here present the case of a patient with a congenital myasthenic syndrome
  (CMS) due to pathogenic variants in the RAPSN gene. During childhood he experienced
  recurrent episodes of respiratory failure during respiratory infections. This and
  other cases were reported as isolated dystrophy of the diaphragmatic musculature.
  In adulthood, whole exome sequencing revealed two heterozygous pathogenic variants
  in the RAPSN gene. This led to the revision of the diagnosis to rapsyn CMS11 (OMIM:616326,
  MONDO:0014588). EMG, muscle ultrasound and the revision of muscle biopsies taken
  in childhood support this diagnosis. After the revision of the diagnosis, treatment
  with pyridostigmine was started. This resulted in a reduction of fatigability and
  an improvement in functional abilities and quality of life.
