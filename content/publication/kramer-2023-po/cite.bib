 abstract = {We here present the case of a patient with a congenital
myasthenic syndrome (CMS) due to pathogenic variants in the
RAPSN gene. During childhood he experienced recurrent episodes
of respiratory failure during respiratory infections. This and
other cases were reported as isolated dystrophy of the
diaphragmatic musculature. In adulthood, whole exome sequencing
revealed two heterozygous pathogenic variants in the RAPSN gene.
This led to the revision of the diagnosis to rapsyn CMS11
(OMIM:616326, MONDO:0014588). EMG, muscle ultrasound and the
revision of muscle biopsies taken in childhood support this
diagnosis. After the revision of the diagnosis, treatment with
pyridostigmine was started. This resulted in a reduction of
fatigability and an improvement in functional abilities and
quality of life.},
