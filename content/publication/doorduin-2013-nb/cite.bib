 abstract = {Evidence has accumulated that respiratory muscle dysfunction
develops in critically ill patients and contributes to prolonged
weaning from mechanical ventilation. Accordingly, it seems
highly appropriate to monitor the respiratory muscles in these
patients. Today, we are only at the beginning of routinely
monitoring respiratory muscle function. Indeed, most clinicians
do not evaluate respiratory muscle function in critically ill
patients at all. In our opinion, however, practical issues and
the absence of sound scientific data for clinical benefit should
not discourage clinicians from having a closer look at
respiratory muscle function in critically ill patients. This
perspective discusses the latest developments in the field of
respiratory muscle monitoring and possible implications of
monitoring respiratory muscle function in critically ill
patients.},
