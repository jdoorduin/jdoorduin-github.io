abstract: Evidence has accumulated that respiratory muscle dysfunction develops in
  critically ill patients and contributes to prolonged weaning from mechanical ventilation.
  Accordingly, it seems highly appropriate to monitor the respiratory muscles in these
  patients. Today, we are only at the beginning of routinely monitoring respiratory
  muscle function. Indeed, most clinicians do not evaluate respiratory muscle function
  in critically ill patients at all. In our opinion, however, practical issues and
  the absence of sound scientific data for clinical benefit should not discourage
  clinicians from having a closer look at respiratory muscle function in critically
  ill patients. This perspective discusses the latest developments in the field of
  respiratory muscle monitoring and possible implications of monitoring respiratory
  muscle function in critically ill patients.
