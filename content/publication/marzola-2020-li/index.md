abstract: The purpose of this study was to develop an automatic method for the segmentation
  of muscle cross-sectional area on transverse B-mode ultrasound images of gastrocnemius
  medialis using a convolutional neural network(CNN). In the provided dataset images
  with both normal and increased echogenicity are present. The manually annotated
  dataset consisted of 591 images, from 200 subjects, 400 relative to subjects with
  normal echogenicity and 191 to subjects with augmented echogenicity. From the DICOM
  files, the image has been extracted and processed using the CNN, then the output
  has been post-processed to obtain a finer segmentation. Final results have been
  compared to the manual segmentations. Precision and Recall scores as mean $±$ standard
  deviation for training, validation, and test sets are 0.96 $±$ 0.05, 0.90 $±$ 0.18,
  0.89 $±$ 0.15 and 0.97 $±$0.03, 0.89$±$ 0.17, 0.90 $±$ 0.14 respectively. The CNN
  approach has also been compared to another automatic algorithm, showing better performances.
  The proposed automatic method provides an accurate estimation of muscle cross-sectional
  area in muscles with different echogenicity levels.
