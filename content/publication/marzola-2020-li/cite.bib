 abstract = {The purpose of this study was to develop an automatic method for
the segmentation of muscle cross-sectional area on transverse
B-mode ultrasound images of gastrocnemius medialis using a
convolutional neural network(CNN). In the provided dataset images
with both normal and increased echogenicity are present. The
manually annotated dataset consisted of 591 images, from 200
subjects, 400 relative to subjects with normal echogenicity and
191 to subjects with augmented echogenicity. From the DICOM
files, the image has been extracted and processed using the CNN,
then the output has been post-processed to obtain a finer
segmentation. Final results have been compared to the manual
segmentations. Precision and Recall scores as mean $±$ standard
deviation for training, validation, and test sets are 0.96 $±$
0.05, 0.90 $±$ 0.18, 0.89 $±$ 0.15 and 0.97 $±$0.03,
0.89$±$ 0.17, 0.90 $±$ 0.14 respectively. The CNN approach
has also been compared to another automatic algorithm, showing
better performances. The proposed automatic method provides an
accurate estimation of muscle cross-sectional area in muscles
with different echogenicity levels.},
