 abstract = {Respiratory muscle dysfunction may develop rapidly in critically
ill ventilated patients and is associated with increased
morbidity, length of intensive care unit stay, costs, and
mortality. This review briefly discusses the pathophysiology of
respiratory muscle dysfunction in intensive care unit patients
and then focuses on strategies that prevent the development of
muscle weakness or, if weakness has developed, how respiratory
muscle function may be improved. We propose a simple strategy
for how these can be implemented in clinical care.},
