abstract: Respiratory muscle dysfunction may develop rapidly in critically ill ventilated
  patients and is associated with increased morbidity, length of intensive care unit
  stay, costs, and mortality. This review briefly discusses the pathophysiology of
  respiratory muscle dysfunction in intensive care unit patients and then focuses
  on strategies that prevent the development of muscle weakness or, if weakness has
  developed, how respiratory muscle function may be improved. We propose a simple
  strategy for how these can be implemented in clinical care.
