abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Patient-ventilator synchrony in patients with COPD is at risk
  during noninvasive ventilation (NIV). NIV in neurally-adjusted ventilatory assist
  (NAVA) mode improves synchrony compared to pressure support ventilation (PSV). The
  current study investigated patient-ventilator interaction at 2 levels of NAVA and
  PSV mode in subjects with COPD exacerbation. METHODS: NIV was randomly applied at
  2 levels (5 and 15 cm H2O) of PSV and NAVA. Patient-ventilator interaction was evaluated
  by comparing airway pressure and electrical activity of the diaphragm waveforms
  with automated computer algorithms. RESULTS: 8 subjects were included. Trigger delay
  was longer in PSV high (268 $±$ 112 ms) than in PSV low (161 $±$ 118 ms, P = .043),
  and trigger delay during NAVA was shorter than PSV for both low support (49 $±$
  24 ms for NAVA, P = .035) and high support (79 $±$ 276 ms for NAVA, P = .003). No
  difference in cycling error for low and high levels of PSV (PSV low -100 $±$ 114
  ms and PSV high 56 $±$ 315 ms) or NAVA (NAVA low -5 $±$ 18 ms, NAVA high 12 $±$
  36 ms) and no difference between PSV and NAVA was found. CONCLUSIONS: Increasing
  PSV levels during NIV caused a progressive mismatch between neural effort and pneumatic
  timing. Patient-ventilator interaction during NAVA was more synchronous than during
  PSV, independent of inspiratory support level. (ClinicalTrials.gov registration
  NCT01791335.).'
