 abstract = {Impaired muscle relaxation is a feature of many neuromuscular
disorders. However, few tests are available to quantify muscle
relaxation. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the motor
cortex can induce muscle relaxation by abruptly inhibiting
corticospinal drive. The aim of our study was to investigate
whether repeatability and reliability of TMS-induced relaxation
are greater than voluntary relaxation. Furthermore, effects of
sex, cooling, and fatigue on muscle relaxation properties were
studied. Muscle relaxation of deep finger flexors was assessed in
25 healthy subjects (14 men and 11 women, age 39.1 $±$ 12.7 and
45.3 $±$ 8.7 yr, respectively) with handgrip dynamometry. All
outcome measures showed greater repeatability and reliability in
TMS-induced relaxation compared with voluntary relaxation. The
within-subject coefficient of variability of normalized peak
relaxation rate was lower in TMS-induced relaxation than in
voluntary relaxation (3.0% vs. 19.7% in men and 6.1% vs.
14.3% in women). The repeatability coefficient was lower (1.3
vs. 6.1 s-1 in men and 2.3 vs. 3.1 s-1 in women) and the
intraclass correlation coefficient was higher (0.95 vs. 0.53 in
men and 0.78 vs. 0.69 in women) for TMS-induced relaxation
compared with voluntary relaxation. TMS enabled demonstration of
slowing effects of sex, muscle cooling, and muscle fatigue on
relaxation properties that voluntary relaxation could not. In
conclusion, repeatability and reliability of TMS-induced muscle
relaxation were greater compared with voluntary muscle
relaxation. TMS-induced muscle relaxation has the potential to be
used in clinical practice for diagnostic purposes and therapy
effect monitoring in patients with impaired muscle relaxation.
NEW & NOTEWORTHY Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)-induced
muscle relaxation demonstrates greater repeatability and
reliability compared with voluntary relaxation, represented by
the ability to demonstrate typical effects of sex, cooling, and
fatigue on muscle relaxation properties that were not seen in
voluntary relaxation. In clinical practice, TMS-induced muscle
relaxation could be used for diagnostic purposes and therapy
effect monitoring. Furthermore, fewer subjects will be needed for
future studies when using TMS to demonstrate differences in
muscle relaxation properties.},
