  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Respiratory muscle training (RMT) aims to improve
               inspiratory and/or expiratory muscle function in neuromuscular
               disorders (NMDs). A comprehensive overview of the available
               literature is lacking. This scoping review explores
               methodological characteristics, (adverse) effects, and adherence
               of RMT studies in NMDs. Moreover, it identifies limitations and
               research gaps in the literature and provides future research
               directions. SUMMARY: Eligible studies were identified using
               MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and
               Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases. Three
               reviewers independently selected articles. Inclusion criteria
               were English language, original research articles on RMT using a
               device, patients with an NMD, and pulmonary function tests or
               respiratory muscle strength as outcome measures. We included
               NMDs with slow, intermediate and fast progression. Exclusion
               criteria were critically ill patients, weaning from mechanical
               ventilation, other neurological disorders, and RMT combined with
               non-respiratory interventions. One reviewer extracted the data
               on patients' characteristics, methodological characteristics,
               results of outcome measures, adverse events, and patient
               adherence. Forty-five studies were identified. We found a large
               diversity in study designs and training protocols. The effects
               of RMT on respiratory muscle strength and/or endurance are
               variable. Patient adherence was high and no serious adverse
               events were reported. KEY MESSAGES: The diversity in studies
               across the available literature precludes definitive conclusions
               regarding the effects of RMT on respiratory muscle function and
               clinically relevant outcomes in NMDs. Therefore, well-powered
               and -designed studies that focus on clinically relevant outcomes
               and assess whether RMT can improve or offset deterioration of
               respiratory muscle weakness in NMDs are needed.",

  abstract  = "INTRODUCTION/AIMS: Needle electromyography (EMG) and muscle
               ultrasound can be used to evaluate patients with suspected
               neuromuscular disorders. The relation between muscle ultrasound
               pathology and the corresponding needle EMG findings is unknown.
               In this study we compared the results of concurrent ultrasound
               and needle EMG examinations in patients suspected of a
               neuromuscular disorder. METHODS: Retrospective data from 218
               patients with pairwise ultrasound and EMG results of 796 muscles
               were analyzed. We compared overall quantitative and visual
               muscle ultrasound results to EMGs with neurogenic and myopathic
               abnormalities and assessed the congruency of both methods in the
               different clinical diagnosis categories. RESULTS: In muscles of
               patients with a neuromuscular disorder, abnormalities were found
               with EMG in 71.8\%, and quantitative and visual muscle
               ultrasound results were abnormal in 19.3\% and 35.4\%
               respectively. In muscles with neurogenic EMG abnormalities,
               quantitative and visual muscle ultrasound results were abnormal
               in 18.9\% versus 35.6\%, increasing up to 43.7\% versus 87.5\%
               in muscles with the most pronounced signs of denervation.
               Congruency of EMG and ultrasound was better for more proximal
               and cranial muscles than for muscles in the hand and lower limb.
               DISCUSSION: Needle EMG and muscle ultrasound typically produce
               disparate results and identify different aspects of muscle
               pathology. Muscle ultrasound seems less suited for detecting
               mild neurogenic abnormalities. As the severity of neurogenic
               needle EMG abnormalities increased, muscle ultrasound
               abnormalities were also increasingly found. Visual analysis
               seems better suited than grayscale quantification for detecting
               neurogenic abnormalities.",

              neuromuscular diseases with respiratory impairment from a young
              age. Prospective natural history studies are needed for
              prevalence estimations, respiratory characterization, optimizing
              clinical care and selecting outcome measures for trial readiness.
              METHODS: Our prospective 1.5-year natural history study included
              spirometry (forced vital capacity (FVC); difference between
              upright and supine vital capacity (dVC)), respiratory muscle
              strength tests (sniff nasal inspiratory pressure (SNIP))
              (age$\geq$5 years), and diaphragm ultrasound (thickness;
              thickening; echogenicity; all ages). RESULTS: Twenty-six LAMA2-MD
              patients (M = 8, median 21 [9; 31] years) and 11 SELENON-RM
              patients (M = 8, 20 [10; 33] years) were included. At baseline,
              17 (85 \%) LAMA2-MD (FVC\%: 59 \% [33; 68]) and all SELENON-RM
              patients (FVC\%: 34 \% [31; 46]) had an impaired respiratory
              function (FVC\%<80 \%). Nine (35 \%) LAMA2-MD and eight (73 \%)
              SELENON-RM patients received mechanical ventilation at baseline,
              and two additional SELENON-RM patients started during follow-up.
              Contrarily to LAMA2-MD, SELENON-RM patients had severe diaphragm
              atrophy (diaphragm thickness z-score: 2.5 [-3.1; -2.1]) and
              dysfunction (diaphragm thickness ratio: 1.2 [1.0; 1.7]; dVC: 30
              \% [7.7; 41]). SNIP was low in both neuromuscular diseases and
              correlated with motor function. In SELENON-RM, respiratory
              function decreased during follow-up. CONCLUSION: The majority of
              LAMA2-MD and all SELENON-RM patients had respiratory impairment.
              SELENON-RM patients showed lower respiratory function which was
              progressive, more prevalent mechanical ventilation, and more
              severe diaphragm atrophy and dysfunction than LAMA2-MD patients.

              (LAMA2-MD) is a rare neuromuscular disease characterized by
              proximal and axial muscle weakness, rigidity of the spine,
              scoliosis, and respiratory impairment. No curative treatment
              options exist, yet promising preclinical studies are ongoing.
              Currently, there is a paucity on natural history data, and
              appropriate clinical and functional outcome measures are needed.
              We aim for deep clinical phenotyping, establishment of a
              well-characterized baseline cohort for prospective follow-up and
              recruitment for future clinical trials, improvement of clinical
              care, and selection of outcome measures for reaching trial
              readiness. Methods: We performed a cross-sectional,
              single-center, observational study. This study included
              neurologic examination and functional measurements among others
              the Motor Function Measure 20/32 (MFM-20/32) as primary outcome
              measure, accelerometry, questionnaires, muscle ultrasound,
              respiratory function tests, electrocardiography and
              echocardiography, and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Results:
              Twenty-seven patients with genetically confirmed LAMA2-MD were
              included (21 $\pm$ 13 years; M = 9; ambulant = 7). Axial and
              proximal muscle weakness was most pronounced. The mean MFM-20/32
              score was 42.0\% $\pm$ 29.4\%, with domain 1 (standing and
              transfers) being severely affected and domain 3 (distal muscle
              function) relatively spared. Physical activity as measured
              through accelerometry showed very strong correlations to
              MFM-20/32 (Pearson correlation, -0.928, p < 0.01). Muscle
              ultrasound showed symmetrically increased echogenicity, with the
              sternocleidomastoid muscle most affected. Respiratory function
              was impaired in 85\% of patients without prominent diaphragm
              dysfunction and was independent of age. Ten patients (37\%)
              needed (non)invasive ventilatory support. Cardiac assessment
              revealed QRS fragmentation in 62\%, abnormal left ventricular
              global longitudinal strain in 25\%, and decreased left
              ventricular ejection fraction in 14\% of patients. Decreased bone
              quality leading to fragility fractures was seen in most of the
              patients. Discussion: LAMA2-MD has a widely variable phenotype.
              Based on the results of this cross-sectional study and current
              standards of care for congenital muscular dystrophies, we advise
              routine cardiorespiratory follow-up and optimization of bone
              quality. We propose MFM-20/32, accelerometry, and muscle
              ultrasound for assessing disease severity and progression. For
              definitive clinical recommendations and outcome measures, natural
              history data are needed. Clinical Trials Registration: This study
              was registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT04478981, 21 July 2020).

               rare congenital neuromuscular disease characterized by proximal
               and axial muscle weakness, spinal rigidity, scoliosis and
               respiratory impairment. No curative treatment options exist, but
               promising preclinical studies are ongoing. Currently, natural
               history data are lacking, while selection of appropriate
               clinical and functional outcome measures is needed to reach
               trial readiness. OBJECTIVE: We aim to identify all Dutch and
               Dutch-speaking Belgian SELENON-RM patients, deep clinical
               phenotyping, trial readiness and optimization of clinical care.
               METHODS: This cross-sectional, single-center, observational
               study comprised neurological examination, functional
               measurements including Motor Function Measurement 20/32
               (MFM-20/32) and accelerometry, questionnaires, muscle
               ultrasound, respiratory function tests, electro- and
               echocardiography, and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. RESULTS:
               Eleven patients with genetically confirmed SELENON-RM were
               included (20$\pm$13 (3-42) years, 73\% male). Axial and proximal
               muscle weakness were most pronounced. The mean MFM-20/32 score
               was 71.2$\pm$15.1\%, with domain 1 (standing and transfers)
               being most severely affected. Accelerometry showed a strong
               correlation with MFM-20/32. Questionnaires revealed impaired
               quality of life, pain and problematic fatigue. Muscle ultrasound
               showed symmetrically increased echogenicity in all muscles.
               Respiratory function, and particularly diaphragm function, was
               impaired in all patients, irrespective of the age. Cardiac
               assessment showed normal left ventricular systolic function in
               all patients but abnormal left ventricular global longitudinal
               strain in 43\% of patients and QRS fragmentation in 80\%.
               Further, 80\% of patients showed decreased bone mineral density
               on dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scan and 55\% of patients
               retrospectively experienced fragility long bone fractures.
               CONCLUSIONS: We recommend cardiorespiratory follow-up as a part
               of routine clinical care in all patients. Furthermore, we advise
               vitamin D supplementation and optimization of calcium intake to
               improve bone quality. We recommend management interventions to
               reduce pain and fatigue. For future clinical trials, we propose
               MFM-20/32, accelerometry and muscle ultrasound to capture
               disease severity and possibly disease progression.",

              study was to investigate if IMT improves respiratory muscle
              strength in patients with nemaline myopathy. METHODS: Nine
              patients (7 females; 2 males, age 36.6$\pm$20.5 years) with
              respiratory muscle weakness and different clinical phenotypes and
              genotypes were included. Patients performed eight weeks of sham
              IMT followed by eight weeks of active threshold IMT. The patients
              trained twice a day five days a week for 15 minutes at home. The
              intensity was constant during the training after a gradual
              increase to 30\% of maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP). RESULTS:
              Active IMT significantly improved MIP from 43$\pm$15.9 to
              47$\pm$16.6 cmH2O (p = 0.019). The effect size was 1.22. There

              feasible in patients with nemaline myopathy and improves
              inspiratory muscle strength. Our findings provide valuable

               (MVC) was assessed on a computerized dynamometer at three
               visits. Also, in a subgroup of 14 post-COVID-19 patients with
               quadriceps muscle weakness, muscle thickness and echo intensity
               were determined by muscle ultrasound of nine upper and lower

               drive to the muscle and consequently induce involuntary muscle
               relaxation. Our aim was to evaluate the reproducibility and the
               effect of varying experimental conditions (robustness) of
               TMS-induced muscle relaxation. Relaxation of deep finger flexors
               was assessed in 10 healthy subjects (5 M, 5 F) using handgrip
               dynamometry with normalized peak relaxation rate as main outcome
               measure, that is, peak relaxation rate divided by (voluntary
               plus TMS-evoked)force prior to relaxation. Both interday and
               interrater reliability of relaxation rate were high with
               intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.88 and 0.92 and
               coefficient of variation of 3.8 and 3.7\%, respectively. Target
               forces of 37.5\% of maximal voluntary force or higher resulted
               in similar relaxation rate. From 50\% of maximal stimulator
               output and higher relaxation rate remained the same. Only the
               most lateral position (>2 cm from the vertex) rendered lower
               relaxation rate (mean $\pm$ SD: 11.1 $\pm$ 3.0 s-1 , 95\% CI:
               9.0-13.3 s-1 ) compared to stimulation at the vertex (12.8 $\pm$
               1.89 s-1 , 95\% CI: 11.6-14.1 s-1 ). Within the range of
               baseline skin temperatures, an average change of 0.5 $\pm$ 0.2
               s-1 in normalized peak relaxation rate was measured per 1°C
               change in skin temperature. In conclusion, interday and
               interrater reproducibility and reliability of TMS-induced muscle
               relaxation of the finger flexors were high. Furthermore, this
               technique is robust with limited effect of target force,
               stimulation intensity, and coil position. Muscle relaxation is
               strongly affected by skin temperature; however, this effect is
               marginal within the normal skin temperature range. We deem this

  abstract  = "INTRODUCTION/AIMS: Diaphragm ultrasound is increasingly used in
               the diagnosis of diaphragm dysfunction and to guide respiratory
               management in patients with neuromuscular disorders and those
               who are critically ill. However, the association between
               diaphragm ultrasound variables and demographic factors like age,
               sex, and body mass index (BMI) are understudied. Such
               relationships are important for correct interpretation of
               normative values and comparison with selected patients groups.
               The aim of this study was to determine the associations between
               diaphragm ultrasound variables and subject characteristics.
               METHODS: B-mode ultrasound was used to image the diaphragm at
               the zone of apposition in 83 healthy subjects. Diaphragm
               thickness at resting end-expiration (Tend-exp ), diaphragm
               thickness at maximal end-inspiration (Tmax-insp ), diaphragm
               thickening ratio (Tmax-insp /Tend-exp ), and diaphragm
               echogenicity were measured. Multivariate linear regression was
               used to explore the associations between diaphragm ultrasound
               variables and subject characteristics. RESULTS: Tend-exp ,
               Tmax-insp , and thickening ratio do not change with age whereas
               diaphragm echogenicity increases with age. The thickening ratio
               had a weak negative association with BMI, while Tend-exp was
               positively associated with BMI. Men had a larger Tend-exp and
               Tmax-insp than women (Tend-exp 1.6 $\pm$ 0.5 and 1.4 $\pm$ 0.3
               mm; p = .011, Tmax-insp 3.8 $\pm$ 1.0 and 3.2 $\pm$ 0.9 mm; p =
               .004), but similar thickening ratios. DISCUSSION: Diaphragm
               thickness, thickening, and echogenicity measured with ultrasound
               are associated with factors such as age, BMI, and sex.
               Therefore, subject characteristics should be considered when
               interpreting diaphragm ultrasound measurements. In the absence
               of normative values, matched control groups are a prerequisite
               for research and in clinical practice.",

               (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) were measured

               electroencephalographic (EEG) patterns in comatose survivors of
               cardiac arrest improves outcomes is uncertain. METHODS: We
               conducted an open-label trial of suppressing rhythmic and
               periodic EEG patterns detected on continuous EEG monitoring in
               comatose survivors of cardiac arrest. Patients were randomly
               assigned in a 1:1 ratio to a stepwise strategy of antiseizure
               medications to suppress this activity for at least 48
               consecutive hours plus standard care (antiseizure-treatment
               group) or to standard care alone (control group); standard care
               included targeted temperature management in both groups. The
               primary outcome was neurologic outcome according to the score on
               the Cerebral Performance Category (CPC) scale at 3 months,
               dichotomized as a good outcome (CPC score indicating no, mild,
               or moderate disability) or a poor outcome (CPC score indicating
               severe disability, coma, or death). Secondary outcomes were
               mortality, length of stay in the intensive care unit (ICU), and
               duration of mechanical ventilation. RESULTS: We enrolled 172
               patients, with 88 assigned to the antiseizure-treatment group
               and 84 to the control group. Rhythmic or periodic EEG activity
               was detected a median of 35 hours after cardiac arrest; 98 of
               157 patients (62\%) with available data had myoclonus. Complete
               suppression of rhythmic and periodic EEG activity for 48
               consecutive hours occurred in 49 of 88 patients (56\%) in the
               antiseizure-treatment group and in 2 of 83 patients (2\%) in the
               control group. At 3 months, 79 of 88 patients (90\%) in the
               antiseizure-treatment group and 77 of 84 patients (92\%) in the
               control group had a poor outcome (difference, 2 percentage
               points; 95\% confidence interval, -7 to 11; P = 0.68). Mortality
               at 3 months was 80\% in the antiseizure-treatment group and 82\%
               in the control group. The mean length of stay in the ICU and
               mean duration of mechanical ventilation were slightly longer in
               the antiseizure-treatment group than in the control group.
               CONCLUSIONS: In comatose survivors of cardiac arrest, the
               incidence of a poor neurologic outcome at 3 months did not
               differ significantly between a strategy of suppressing rhythmic
               and periodic EEG activity with the use of antiseizure medication
               for at least 48 hours plus standard care and standard care

               nucleus (STN-DBS) has become a cornerstone in the advanced
               treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD). Despite its
               well-established clinical benefit, there is a significant
               variation in the way surgery is performed. Most centers operate
               with the patient awake to allow for microelectrode recording
               (MER) and intraoperative clinical testing. However, technical
               advances in MR imaging and MRI-guided surgery raise the question
               whether MER and intraoperative clinical testing still have added
               value in DBS-surgery. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the added value of
               MER and intraoperative clinical testing to determine final lead
               position in awake MRI-guided and stereotactic CT-verified
               STN-DBS surgery for PD. METHODS: 29 consecutive patients were
               analyzed retrospectively. Patients underwent awake bilateral
               STN-DBS with MER and intraoperative clinical testing. The role
               of MER and clinical testing in determining final lead position
               was evaluated. Furthermore, interobserver variability in
               determining the MRI-defined STN along the planned trajectory was
               investigated. Clinical improvement was evaluated at 12 months
               follow-up and adverse events were recorded. RESULTS: 98\% of
               final leads were placed in the central MER-track with an
               accuracy of 0.88$\pm$0.45 mm. Interobserver variability of the
               MRI-defined STN was 0.84$\pm$0.09. Compared to baseline, mean
               improvement in MDS-UPDRS-III, PDQ-39 and LEDD were 26.7$\pm$16.0
               points (54\%) (p < 0.001), 9.0$\pm$20.0 points (19\%) (p =
               0.025), and 794$\pm$434 mg/day (59\%) (p < 0.001) respectively.
               There were 19 adverse events in 11 patients, one of which (lead
               malposition requiring immediate postoperative revision) was a
               serious adverse event. CONCLUSION: MER and intraoperative

               patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) due
               to dynamic airway collapse and/or increased airway resistance,
               increasing the risk of volutrauma and hemodynamic compromise.
               The reference standard to quantify dynamic pulmonary
               hyperinflation is the measurement of the volume at
               end-inspiration (Vei). As this is cumbersome, the aim of this
               study was to evaluate if methods that are easier to perform at
               the bedside can accurately reflect Vei. METHODS: Vei was
               assessed in COPD patients under controlled protective mechanical
               ventilation (7 $\pm$ mL/kg) on zero end-expiratory pressure,
               using three techniques in a fixed order: (1) reference standard
               (Veireference): passive exhalation to atmosphere from
               end-inspiration in a calibrated glass burette; (2) ventilator
               maneuver (Veimaneuver): measuring the expired volume during a
               passive exhalation of 45s using the ventilator flow sensor; (3)
               formula (Veiformula): (Vt $\times$ Pplateau)/(Pplateau - PEEPi),
               with Vt tidal volume, Pplateau is plateau pressure after an
               end-inspiratory occlusion, and PEEPi is intrinsic positive
               end-expiratory pressure after an end-expiratory occlusion. A
               convenience sample of 17 patients was recruited. RESULTS:
               Veireference was 1030 $\pm$ 380 mL and had no significant
               correlation with Pplateau (r2 = 0.06; P = 0.3710) or PEEPi (r2 =
               0.11; P = 0.2156), and was inversely related with Pdrive
               (calculated as Pplateau -PEEPi) (r2 = 0.49; P = 0.0024). A low
               bias but rather wide limits of agreement and fairly good
               correlations were found when comparing Veimaneuver and
               Veiformula to Veireference. Vei remained stable during the study
               period (low bias 15 mL with high agreement (95\% limits of
               agreement from - 100 to 130 mL) and high correlation (r2 = 0.98;
               P < 0.0001) between both measurements of Veireference).
               CONCLUSIONS: In patients with COPD, airway pressures are not a
               valid representation of Vei. The three techniques to quantify
               Vei show low bias, but wide limits of agreement.",

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: SELENON (SEPN1)-related myopathy (SELENON-RM) is a
               rare congenital myopathy characterized by slowly progressive
               proximal muscle weakness, early onset spine rigidity and
               respiratory insufficiency. A muscular dystrophy caused by
               mutations in the LAMA2 gene (LAMA2-related muscular dystrophy,
               LAMA2-MD) has a similar clinical phenotype, with either a
               severe, early-onset due to complete Laminin subunit $\alpha$2
               deficiency (merosin-deficient congenital muscular dystrophy type
               1A (MDC1A)), or a mild, childhood- or adult-onset due to partial
               Laminin subunit $\alpha$2 deficiency. For both muscle diseases,
               no curative treatment options exist, yet promising preclinical
               studies are ongoing. Currently, there is a paucity on natural
               history data and appropriate clinical and functional outcome
               measures are needed to reach trial readiness. METHODS: LAST
               STRONG is a natural history study in Dutch-speaking patients of
               all ages diagnosed with SELENON-RM or LAMA2-MD, starting August
               2020. Patients have four visits at our hospital over a period of
               1.5 year. At all visits, they undergo standardized neurological
               examination, hand-held dynamometry (age $\geq$ 5 years),
               functional measurements, questionnaires (patient report and/or
               parent proxy; age $\geq$ 2 years), muscle ultrasound including
               diaphragm, pulmonary function tests (spirometry, maximal
               inspiratory and expiratory pressure, sniff nasal inspiratory
               pressure; age $\geq$ 5 years), and accelerometry for 8 days (age
               $\geq$ 2 years); at visit one and three, they undergo cardiac
               evaluation (electrocardiogram, echocardiography; age $\geq$ 2
               years), spine X-ray (age $\geq$ 2 years), dual-energy X-ray
               absorptiometry (DEXA-)scan (age $\geq$ 2 years) and full body
               magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (age $\geq$ 10 years). All
               examinations are adapted to the patient's age and functional
               abilities. Correlation between key parameters within and between
               subsequent visits will be assessed. DISCUSSION: Our study will
               describe the natural history of patients diagnosed with
               SELENON-RM or LAMA2-MD, enabling us to select relevant clinical
               and functional outcome measures for reaching clinical
               trial-readiness. Moreover, our detailed description (deep
               phenotyping) of the clinical features will optimize clinical
               management and will establish a well-characterized baseline
               cohort for prospective follow-up. CONCLUSION: Our natural
               history study is an essential step for reaching trial readiness
               in SELENON-RM and LAMA2-MD. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This study has

               for studying physiological and pathological muscles. An
               automatic deep learning (DL) system for the analysis of
               ultrasound images could be useful to support an expert operator,
               allowing the study of large datasets requiring less human
               interaction. The purpose of this study is to present a deep
               learning algorithm for the cross-sectional area (CSA)
               segmentation in transverse musculoskeletal ultrasound images,
               providing a quantitative grayscale analysis which is useful for
               studying muscles, and to validate the results in a large
               dataset. The dataset included 3917 images of biceps brachii,
               tibialis anterior and gastrocnemius medialis acquired on 1283
               subjects (mean age 50 $\pm$ 21 years, 729 male). The algorithm
               was based on multiple deep-learning architectures, and its
               performance was compared to a manual expert segmentation. We
               compared the mean grayscale value inside the automatic and
               manual CSA using Bland-Altman plots and a correlation analysis.
               Classification in healthy and abnormal muscles between automatic
               and manual segmentation were compared using the grayscale value
               z-scores. In the test set, a Precision of 0.88 $\pm$ 0.12 and a
               Recall of 0.92 $\pm$ 0.09 was achieved. The network segmentation
               performance was slightly less in abnormal muscles, without a
               loss of discrimination between healthy and abnormal muscle
               images. Bland-Altman plots showed no clear trend in the error
               distribution and the two readings have a 0.99 Pearson's
               correlation coefficient (p < 0.001, test set). The ICC(A, 1)
               calculated between the z-score readings was 0.99. The algorithm
               achieves robust CSA segmentation performance and gives mean
               grayscale level information comparable to a manual operator.
               This could provide a helpful tool for clinicians in
               neuromuscular disease diagnosis and follow-up. The entire

               is at risk during noninvasive ventilation (NIV). NIV in

               synchrony compared to pressure support ventilation (PSV). The
               current study investigated patient-ventilator interaction at 2
               levels of NAVA and PSV mode in subjects with COPD exacerbation.
               METHODS: NIV was randomly applied at 2 levels (5 and 15 cm H2O)
               of PSV and NAVA. Patient-ventilator interaction was evaluated by
               comparing airway pressure and electrical activity of the
               diaphragm waveforms with automated computer algorithms. RESULTS:
               8 subjects were included. Trigger delay was longer in PSV high
               (268 $\pm$ 112 ms) than in PSV low (161 $\pm$ 118 ms, P = .043),
               and trigger delay during NAVA was shorter than PSV for both low
               support (49 $\pm$ 24 ms for NAVA, P = .035) and high support (79
               $\pm$ 276 ms for NAVA, P = .003). No difference in cycling error
               for low and high levels of PSV (PSV low -100 $\pm$ 114 ms and
               PSV high 56 $\pm$ 315 ms) or NAVA (NAVA low -5 $\pm$ 18 ms, NAVA
               high 12 $\pm$ 36 ms) and no difference between PSV and NAVA was
               found. CONCLUSIONS: Increasing PSV levels during NIV caused a
               progressive mismatch between neural effort and pneumatic timing.
               Patient-ventilator interaction during NAVA was more synchronous
               than during PSV, independent of inspiratory support level.

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Inappropriate ventilator assist plays an important
               role in the development of diaphragm dysfunction. Ventilator
               under-assist may lead to muscle injury, while over-assist may
               result in muscle atrophy. This provides a good rationale to
               monitor respiratory drive in ventilated patients. Respiratory
               drive can be monitored by a nasogastric catheter, either with
               esophageal balloon to determine muscular pressure (gold
               standard) or with electrodes to measure electrical activity of
               the diaphragm. A disadvantage is that both techniques are
               invasive. Therefore, it is interesting to investigate the role
               of surrogate markers for respiratory dive, such as
               extradiaphragmatic inspiratory muscle activity. The aim of the
               current study was to investigate the effect of different
               inspiratory support levels on the recruitment pattern of
               extradiaphragmatic inspiratory muscles with respect to the
               diaphragm and to evaluate agreement between activity of
               extradiaphragmatic inspiratory muscles and the diaphragm.
               METHODS: Activity from the alae nasi, genioglossus, scalene,
               sternocleidomastoid and parasternal intercostals was recorded
               using surface electrodes. Electrical activity of the diaphragm
               was measured using a multi-electrode nasogastric catheter.
               Pressure support (PS) levels were reduced from 15 to 3 cmH2O
               every 5 min with steps of 3 cmH2O. The magnitude and timing of
               respiratory muscle activity were assessed. RESULTS: We included
               17 ventilated patients. Diaphragm and extradiaphragmatic
               inspiratory muscle activity increased in response to lower PS
               levels (36 $\pm$ 6\% increase for the diaphragm, 30 $\pm$ 6\%
               parasternal intercostals, 41 $\pm$ 6\% scalene, 40 $\pm$ 8\%
               sternocleidomastoid, 43 $\pm$ 6\% alae nasi and 30 $\pm$ 6\%
               genioglossus). Changes in diaphragm activity correlated best
               with changes in alae nasi activity (r2 = 0.49; P < 0.001), while
               there was no correlation between diaphragm and
               sternocleidomastoid activity. The agreement between diaphragm
               and extradiaphragmatic inspiratory muscle activity was low due
               to a high individual variability. Onset of alae nasi activity
               preceded the onset of all other muscles. CONCLUSIONS:
               Extradiaphragmatic inspiratory muscle activity increases in
               response to lower inspiratory support levels. However, there is
               a poor correlation and agreement with the change in diaphragm
               activity, limiting the use of surface electromyography (EMG)
               recordings of extradiaphragmatic inspiratory muscles as a
               surrogate for electrical activity of the diaphragm.",

  abstract  = "OBJECT: Surgery of tumours in the cerebellopontine angle (CPA)
               can lead to loss of facial nerve function. Different methods of
               intra-operative nerve monitoring (IOM) (including free-running
               EMG, direct nerve stimulation and transcranial motor evoked
               potentials (TcMEP)) have been used to predict facial nerve
               outcome during surgery. Recent research has shown TcMEP
               threshold increase and the occurrence of A-trains on the EMG to
               have great potential in doing so. This study compares these two
               methods and correlates them to House-Brackmann (HB) scores
               post-op in patients with tumours in the cerebellopontine angle.
               METHOD: Forty-three patients (one was operated twice) with large
               CPA tumours treated surgically in the Radboud University Medical
               Center between 2015 and 2019 were included in this study. During
               surgery, TcMEP threshold increases and A-train activity were
               measured. Because our treatment paradigm aims at facial nerve
               preservation (accepting residual tumour), TcMEP threshold
               increase of over 20 mA or occurrence of A-trains were considered
               as warning signs and used as a guide for terminating surgery. HB
               scores were measured post-op, at 6 weeks, 6 months and 1 year
               after surgery. Spearman's correlation was calculated between the
               IOM-values and the HB scores for a homogeneous subgroup of 30
               patients with vestibular schwannoma (VS) without
               neurofibromatosis type II (NF-II) and all patients collectively.
               RESULTS: TcMEP threshold was successfully measured in 39
               (90.7\%) procedures. In the homogeneous VS non-NFII group, we
               found a statistically significant moderate-to-strong correlation
               between TcMEP threshold increase and House Brackmann score
               immediately post-op, at 6 weeks, 6 months and 1 year after
               surgery (Spearman's rho of 0.79 (p < 0.001), 0.74 (p < 0.001),
               0.64 (p < 0.001) and 0.58 (p = 0.002), respectively). For
               A-trains, no correlation was found. Similar results were found
               when including all patients with CPA tumours. A threshold
               increase of < 20 mA was a predictor of good facial nerve
               outcome. CONCLUSION: These results show that TcMEP threshold
               increases are strongly correlated to post-operative HB scores,
               while A-trains are not. This suggests TcMEP threshold increases
               can be a valuable predictor for facial nerve outcome in patients
               with large tumours when facial nerve preservation is prioritized
               over total resection. In this study, we found no use for
               A-trains to prevent facial nerve deficits.",

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Studies have shown co-contraction of jaw and neck
               muscles in healthy subjects during (sub) maximum voluntary jaw
               clenching, indicating functional inter-relation between these
               muscles during awake bruxism. So far, coherence of jaw and neck
               muscles has not been evaluated during either awake or sleep
               bruxism. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate
               the coherence between jaw and neck muscle activity during sleep
               bruxism. METHODS: In a cross-sectional observational design, the
               electromyographic activity of jaw (masseter, temporalis) and
               neck (sternocleidomastoid, trapezius) muscles in individuals
               with ``definite'' sleep bruxism was measured using ambulatory
               polysomnography (PSG). Coherence for masseter-temporalis,
               masseter-sternocleidomastoid and masseter-trapezius was measured
               during phasic and mixed rhythmic masticatory muscle activity
               episodes using coherence-analysing software. Outcome measures
               were as follows: presence or absence of significant coherence
               per episode (in percentages), frequency of peak coherence (FPC)
               per episode and sleep stage. RESULTS: A total of 632 episodes
               within 16 PSGs of eight individuals were analysed. Significant
               coherence was found between the jaw and neck muscles in 84.9\%
               of the episodes. FPCs of masseter-temporalis were significantly
               positively correlated with those of masseter-sternocleidomastoid
               or masseter-trapezius (P < .001). Sleep stages did not
               significantly influence coherence of these muscular couples.
               CONCLUSION: During sleep bruxism, jaw and neck muscle activation
               is significantly coherent. Coherence occurs independently of
               sleep stage. These results support the hypothesis of bruxism
               being a centrally regulated phenomenon.",

               caused by mutations in KBTBD13 (NEM6). In addition to weakness,

               binds to actin - a major constituent of the thin filament - and
               that mutations in KBTBD13 cause structural changes impairing
               muscle-relaxation kinetics. We propose that this actin-based
               impaired relaxation is central to NEM6 pathology.",

               critically ill patients and is associated with adverse outcome,
               including difficult weaning from mechanical ventilation. Today,
               no drug is approved to improve respiratory muscle function in
               these patients. Previously, we have shown that the calcium
               sensitizer levosimendan improves calcium sensitivity of human
               diaphragm muscle fibers in vitro and contractile efficiency of
               the diaphragm in healthy subjects. The main purpose of this
               study is to investigate the effects of levosimendan on diaphragm
               contractile efficiency in mechanically ventilated patients.
               METHODS: In a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial,
               mechanically ventilated patients performed two 30-min continuous
               positive airway pressure (CPAP) trials with 5-h interval. After
               the first CPAP trial, study medication (levosimendan 0.2
               µg/kg/min continuous infusion or placebo) was administered.
               During the CPAP trials, electrical activity of the diaphragm
               (EAdi), transdiaphragmatic pressure (Pdi), and flow were
               measured. Neuromechanical efficiency (primary outcome parameter)

               the study. Neuromechanical efficiency was not different during
               the CPAP trial after levosimendan administration compared to the
               CPAP trial before study medication. Tidal volume and minute
               ventilation were higher after levosimendan administration (11
               and 21\%, respectively), whereas EAdi and Pdi were higher in
               both groups in the CPAP trial after study medication compared to
               the CPAP trial before study medication. CONCLUSIONS:

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) is the most
               common subtype among the autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias,
               a group of neurodegenerative disorders for which currently no
               disease-specific therapy is available. Evidence-based options
               for symptomatic treatment of ataxia are also limited. Recent
               investigations in a heterogeneous group of hereditary and
               acquired ataxias showed promising, prolonged effects of a
               two-week course with daily sessions of cerebellar anodal
               transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) on ataxia
               severity, gait speed, and upper limb dexterity. The aim of the
               SCA3-tDCS study is to further examine whether tDCS improves
               ataxia severity and various (cerebellar) non-motor symptoms in a
               homogeneous cohort of SCA3 patients and to explore the time
               course of these effects. METHODS/DESIGN: An
               investigator-initiated, double-blind, randomized,
               sham-controlled, single-center trial will be conducted. Twenty
               mildly to moderately affected SCA3 patients (Scale for the
               Assessment and Rating of Ataxia score between 3 and 20) will be
               included and randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either
               cerebellar anodal tDCS or sham cerebellar tDCS. Patients,
               investigators, and outcome assessors are unaware of treatment
               allocation. Cerebellar tDCS (20 min, 2 mA, ramp-up and down
               periods of 30 s each) will be delivered over ten sessions,
               distributed in two groups of five consecutive days with a
               two-day break in between. Outcomes are assessed after a single
               session of tDCS, after the tenth stimulation (T1), and after
               three, six, and twelve months. The primary outcome measure is
               the absolute change of the SARA score between baseline and T1.
               In addition, effects on a variety of other motor and
               neuropsychological functions in which the cerebellum is known to
               be involved will be evaluated using quantitative motor tests,
               static posturography, neurophysiological measurements, cognitive
               assessment, and questionnaires. DISCUSSION: The results of this
               study will inform us whether repeated sessions of cerebellar
               anodal tDCS benefit SCA3 patients and whether this form of
               non-invasive stimulation might be a novel therapeutic approach
               to consider in a neurorehabilitation setting. Combined with two
               earlier controlled trials, a positive effect of the SCA3-tDCS
               study will encourage implementation of this intervention and
               stimulate further research in other SCAs and heredodegenerative
               ataxias. TRIAL REGISTRATION: NL7321 , registered October 8,

               technique for early detection could help select patients for
               potential treatments. We assessed the use of a simple surface
               electromyography (sEMG) in patients directly after oxaliplatin
               infusion. METHODS: In patients with colorectal cancer, acute
               neurotoxicity was evaluated by means of a physical examination,
               a questionnaire, and sEMG directly after the second and fourth
               cycle of oxaliplatin. Questionnaires were also assessed 1 day
               after infusion. RESULTS: 14 patients were measured after the
               second cycle and 8 patients were also measured after the fourth
               cycle of oxaliplatin. All patients reported to a variable degree
               oxaliplatin induced neurotoxicity symptoms: sensitivity to
               touching cold or swallowing cold items were reported as most
               severe. Clinical signs of hyperexcitability were observed in

               coefficients ( R) were computed to determine within-individual
               and overall relationships between Pdi and SMdi, respectively.
               During closed-airways maneuvers, mean Pdi correlated to mean
               SMdi in all participants [ r ranged from 0.77 to 0.96, all P <

               Pdi swing correlated to maximal SMdi in all participants [ r

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Diaphragm dysfunction develops frequently in
               ventilated intensive care unit (ICU) patients. Both disuse
               atrophy (ventilator over-assist) and high respiratory muscle
               effort (ventilator under-assist) seem to be involved. A strong
               rationale exists to monitor diaphragm effort and titrate support
               to maintain respiratory muscle activity within physiological
               limits. Diaphragm electromyography is used to quantify breathing
               effort and has been correlated with transdiaphragmatic pressure
               and esophageal pressure. The neuromuscular efficiency index
               (NME) can be used to estimate inspiratory effort, however its
               repeatability has not been investigated yet. Our goal is to
               evaluate NME repeatability during an end-expiratory occlusion
               (NMEoccl) and its use to estimate the pressure generated by the
               inspiratory muscles (Pmus). METHODS: This is a prospective
               cohort study, performed in a medical-surgical ICU. A total of 31
               adult patients were included, all ventilated in neurally
               adjusted ventilator assist (NAVA) mode with an electrical
               activity of the diaphragm (EAdi) catheter in situ. At four time
               points within 72 h five repeated end-expiratory occlusion
               maneuvers were performed. NMEoccl was calculated by delta airway
               pressure ($\Delta$Paw)/$\Delta$EAdi and was used to estimate
               Pmus. The repeatability coefficient (RC) was calculated to
               investigate the NMEoccl variability. RESULTS: A total number of
               459 maneuvers were obtained. At time T = 0 mean NMEoccl was 1.22
               $\pm$ 0.86 cmH2O/$\mu$V with a RC of 82.6\%. This implies that
               when NMEoccl is 1.22 cmH2O/$\mu$V, it is expected with a
               probability of 95\% that the subsequent measured NMEoccl will be
               between 2.22 and 0.22 cmH2O/$\mu$V. Additional EAdi waveform
               analysis to correct for non-physiological appearing waveforms,
               did not improve NMEoccl variability. Selecting three out of five
               occlusions with the lowest variability reduced the RC to 29.8\%.
               CONCLUSIONS: Repeated measurements of NMEoccl exhibit high
               variability, limiting the ability of a single NMEoccl maneuver
               to estimate neuromuscular efficiency and therefore the pressure

              THAT IS NEW: BACKGROUND:: Respiratory muscle weakness in
              critically ill patients is associated with difficulty in weaning
              from mechanical ventilation. Previous studies have mainly focused
              on inspiratory muscle activity during weaning; expiratory muscle
              activity is less well understood. The current study describes
              expiratory muscle activity during weaning, including tonic
              diaphragm activity. The authors hypothesized that expiratory
              muscle effort is greater in patients who fail to wean compared to
              those who wean successfully. METHODS: Twenty adult patients
              receiving mechanical ventilation (more than 72 h) performed a
              spontaneous breathing trial. Tidal volume, transdiaphragmatic
              pressure, diaphragm electrical activity, and diaphragm
              neuromechanical efficiency were calculated on a breath-by-breath
              basis. Inspiratory (and expiratory) muscle efforts were
              calculated as the inspiratory esophageal (and expiratory gastric)
              pressure-time products, respectively. RESULTS: Nine patients
              failed weaning. The contribution of the expiratory muscles to
              total respiratory muscle effort increased in the ``failure''
              group from 13 $\pm$ 9\% at onset to 24 $\pm$ 10\% at the end of
              the breathing trial (P = 0.047); there was no increase in the
              ``success'' group. Diaphragm electrical activity (expressed as
              the percentage of inspiratory peak) was low at end expiration
              (failure, 3 $\pm$ 2\%; success, 4 $\pm$ 6\%) and equal between
              groups during the entire expiratory phase (P = 0.407). Diaphragm
              neuromechanical efficiency was lower in the failure versus
              success groups (0.38 $\pm$ 0.16 vs. 0.71 $\pm$ 0.36 cm
              H2O/$\mu$V; P = 0.054). CONCLUSIONS: Weaning failure (vs.
              success) is associated with increased effort of the expiratory
              muscles and impaired neuromechanical efficiency of the diaphragm
              but no difference in tonic activity of the diaphragm.",

              are greater than voluntary relaxation. Furthermore, effects of

              treated with MCS were studied. The analgesic effect was
              determined as successful by decrease in pain-intensity on the
              visual analog scale (VAS) of at least 40\%. The modifications in
              drug regimens were monitored with use of the medication
              quantification scale (MQS). Stimulation parameters and
              complications were also noted. Interference of pain with quality
              of life (QoL), the Quality of Life Index (QLI), was determined
              with use of a specific subset of questions from the MPQ-DLV
              score. RESULTS: Eighteen patients were included. Mean
              pre-operative VAS changed from 89.4 $\pm$ 11.2 to 53.1 $\pm$ 25.0
              after three years of follow-up (P < 0.0001). A successful outcome
              was achieved in seven responders (38.9\%). All patients in the
              responder group suffered from pain caused by a central lesion.
              With regard to all the patients with central pain lesions (n =
              10) and peripheral lesions (n = 8), a significant difference in
              response to MCS was noticed (P = 0.002). MQS scores and
              QLI-scores diminished during the follow-up period (P = 0.210 and
              P = 0.007, respectively). CONCLUSION: MCS seems a promising
              therapeutic option for patients with refractory pain syndromes of
              central origin.",

               established treatment for respiratory failure in patients with
               amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Several studies have shown
               room for improvement with regard to respiratory care for ALS
               patients, including latency of referral. These studies focused
               on the time period starting at the moment of referral to a home
               ventilation service (HVS) onwards. In the current study we
               performed a nationwide survey to gain insight in the trajectory
               before referral. We questioned the assessment of respiratory
               impairment by ALS physicians/care teams, including criteria for
               referral to an HVS. METHODS: We requested 40 ALS care teams in
               the Netherlands to fill in an online questionnaire on
               respiratory management in ALS patients. RESULTS: Thirty-two ALS
               care teams (80\%) responded. Forced vital capacity was the most
               frequently used test at each outpatient visit (72\%) and often
               served as a criterion (78\%) for referral to an HVS. Other
               respiratory function measurements that were performed less often
               included peak cough flow (50\%), maximum inspiratory/expiratory
               pressure (31\% /28\%) and sniff nasal inspiratory pressure
               (13\%). Morning headache was the most frequently questioned
               complaint (94\%), followed by daytime sleepiness (91\%).
               Dyspnoea and orthopnoea were reported by 38\% and 59\% as
               important complaints. Out of all patients under the care of the
               ALS care teams, the mean estimated proportion of patients that
               was referred to an HVS was 69\% (range 20-100\%). When
               physicians refrained from referral, the most often cited reasons
               were patient's decision to withhold NIV (94\%) and cognitive
               impairment (50\%). Sixteen percent of the respondents stated
               bulbar impairment as a reason to refrain from referral.
               CONCLUSION: Despite findings in previous studies on the
               superiority of SNIP and PCF as compared to FVC, our study shows
               that a majority of ALS care teams still prefers to use FVC for
               the assessment of respiratory dysfunction and for the timing of
               referral to an HVS. Another finding is that bulbar impairment is
               not an obstacle for referral for NIV.",

               investigation, which can be easily performed at the bedside on
               the ICU. A reduction in muscle thickness and increase in echo
               intensity over time have been described in ICU patients, but the
               relation to ICU-acquired weakness (ICU-AW) is unknown. We
               hypothesized that quantitative assessment of muscle and nerve
               parameters with ultrasound can differentiate between patients
               with and without ICU-AW. The aim of this cross-sectional study
               was to investigate the diagnostic accuracy of neuromuscular
               ultrasound for diagnosing ICU-AW. METHODS: Newly admitted ICU
               patients, mechanically ventilated for at least 48 h, were
               included. As soon as patients were awake and attentive, an
               ultrasound was made of four muscles and two nerves (index test)
               and ICU-AW was evaluated using muscle strength testing
               (reference standard; ICU-AW defined as mean Medical Research
               Council score <4). Diagnostic accuracy of muscle thickness, echo
               intensity and homogeneity (echo intensity standard deviation) as
               well as nerve cross-sectional area, thickness and
               vascularization were evaluated with the area under the curve of
               the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC-AUC). We also
               evaluated diagnostic accuracy of z-scores of muscle thickness,
               echo intensity and echo intensity standard deviation. RESULTS:
               Seventy-one patients were evaluated of whom 41 had ICU-AW.
               Ultrasound was done at a median of 7 days after admission in
               patients without ICU-AW and 9 days in patients with ICU-AW.
               Diagnostic accuracy of all muscle and nerve parameters was low.
               ROC-AUC ranged from 51.3 to 68.0\% for muscle parameters and
               from 51.0 to 66.7\% for nerve parameters. CONCLUSION:
               Neuromuscular ultrasound does not discriminate between patients
               with and without ICU-AW at the time the patient awakens and is
               therefore not able to reliably diagnose ICU-AW in ICU patients

              critically ill patients in the phase of weaning. Fractional
              thickening during inspiration assessed by ultrasound has been
              used to estimate diaphragm effort. It is unknown whether more
              sophisticated ultrasound techniques such as speckle tracking are
              superior in the quantification of inspiratory effort. This study
              evaluates the validity of speckle tracking ultrasound to quantify
              diaphragm contractility. Thirteen healthy volunteers underwent a
              randomized stepwise threshold loading protocol of 0-50\% of the
              maximal inspiratory pressure. Electric activity of the diaphragm
              and transdiaphragmatic pressures were recorded. Speckle tracking
              ultrasound was used to assess strain and strain rate as measures
              of diaphragm tissue deformation and deformation velocity,
              respectively. Fractional thickening was assessed by measurement
              of diaphragm thickness at end-inspiration and end-expiration.
              Strain and strain rate increased with progressive loading of the
              diaphragm. Both strain and strain rate were highly correlated to
              transdiaphragmatic pressure (strain r2 = 0.72; strain rate r2 =
              0.80) and diaphragm electric activity (strain r2 = 0.60; strain
              rate r2 = 0.66). We conclude that speckle tracking ultrasound is
              superior to conventional ultrasound techniques to estimate
              diaphragm contractility under inspiratory threshold loading.NEW
              \& NOTEWORTHY Transdiaphragmatic pressure using esophageal and
              gastric balloons is the gold standard to assess diaphragm effort.
              However, this technique is invasive and requires expertise, and
              the interpretation may be complex. We report that speckle
              tracking ultrasound can be used to detect stepwise increases in
              diaphragmatic effort. Strain and strain rate were highly
              correlated with transdiaphragmatic pressure, and therefore,
              diaphragm electric activity and speckle tracking might serve as
              reliable tools to quantify diaphragm effort in the future.",

              quality of life in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients.
              The timing of referral to a home ventilation service (HVS), which
              is in part based on respiratory function tests, has shown room
              for improvement. It is currently unknown which respiratory
              function test predicts an appropriate timing of the initiation of
              NIV. METHODS: We analysed, retrospectively, serial data of five
              respiratory function tests: forced vital capacity (FVC), peak
              cough flow (PCF), maximum inspiratory and expiratory pressure
              (MIP and MEP) and sniff nasal inspiratory pressure (SNIP) in
              patients with ALS. Patients who had had at least one assessment
              of respiratory function and one visit at the HVS, were included.
              Our aim was to detect the test with the highest predictive value
              for the need for elective NIV in the following 3 months. We
              analysed time curves, currently used cut-off values for referral,
              and respiratory function test results between 'NIV indication'
              and 'no-NIV indication' patients. RESULTS: One hundred ten
              patients with ALS were included of whom 87 received an NIV
              indication; 11.5\% had one assessment before receiving an NIV
              indication, 88.5\% had two or more assessments. The NIV
              indication was based on complaints of hypoventilation and/or
              proven (nocturnal) hypercapnia. The five respiratory function
              tests showed a descending trend during disease progression, where
              SNIP showed the greatest decline within the latest 3 months
              before NIV indication (mean = -22\%). PCF at the time of referral
              to the HVS significantly discriminated between the groups
              'NIV-indication' and 'no NIV-indication yet' patients at the
              first HVS visit: 259 ($\pm$92) vs. 348 ($\pm$137) L/min, p =
              0.019. PCF and SNIP showed the best predictive characteristics in
              terms of sensitivity. CONCLUSION: SNIP showed the greatest
              decline prior to NIV indication and PCF significantly
              differentiated 'NIV-indication' from 'no NIV-indication yet'
              patients with ALS. Currently used cut-off values might be
              adjusted and other respiratory function tests such as SNIP and
              PCF may become part of routine care in patients with ALS in order

               lung-protective ventilation in patients with acute respiratory
               distress syndrome. Despite recognized benefits, such as
               preserved diaphragm activity, partial support ventilation modes
               may be incompatible with lung-protective ventilation due to high
               Vt and high transpulmonary pressure. As an alternative to
               high-dose sedatives and controlled mechanical ventilation,
               pharmacologically induced neuromechanical uncoupling of the
               diaphragm should facilitate lung-protective ventilation under
               partial support modes. OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether
               partial neuromuscular blockade can facilitate lung-protective
               ventilation while maintaining diaphragm activity under partial
               ventilatory support. METHODS: In a proof-of-concept study, we
               enrolled 10 patients with lung injury and a Vt greater than 8
               ml/kg under pressure support ventilation (PSV) and under
               sedation. After baseline measurements, rocuronium administration
               was titrated to a target Vt of 6 ml/kg during neurally adjusted
               ventilatory assist (NAVA). Thereafter, patients were ventilated
               in PSV and NAVA under continuous rocuronium infusion for 2
               hours. Respiratory parameters, hemodynamic parameters, and blood
               gas values were measured. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS:
               Rocuronium titration resulted in significant declines of Vt
               (mean $\pm$ SEM, 9.3 $\pm$ 0.6 to 5.6 $\pm$ 0.2 ml/kg; P <
               0.0001), transpulmonary pressure (26.7 $\pm$ 2.5 to 10.7 $\pm$
               1.2 cm H2O; P < 0.0001), and diaphragm electrical activity (17.4
               $\pm$ 2.3 to 4.5 $\pm$ 0.7 $\mu$V; P < 0.0001), and could be
               maintained under continuous rocuronium infusion. During
               titration, pH decreased (7.42 $\pm$ 0.02 to 7.35 $\pm$ 0.02; P <
               0.0001), and mean arterial blood pressure increased (84 $\pm$ 6
               to 99 $\pm$ 6 mm Hg; P = 0.0004), as did heart rate (83 $\pm$ 7
               to 93 $\pm$ 8 beats/min; P = 0.0004). CONCLUSIONS: Partial
               neuromuscular blockade facilitates lung-protective ventilation

              interposes on the needle electrode insertion path during
              diaphragm electromyography (EMG). METHODS: Using high-resolution
              ultrasonography, we measured the distances between the medial
              recess of the intercostal spaces (ICSs) around the mid-clavicular
              line (MCL) and the lung margin. We performed measurements
              bilaterally during quiet breathing in the seated and supine
              positions. RESULTS: We studied 10 young healthy men and found
              that, in the first ICS with the medial recess clearly (i.e.,
              several cm) lateral to MCL (usually the eighth ICS), the distance
              between the recommended insertion site and the lung margin varied
              from 7.5 to 17 cm. The distance was slightly larger on the right
              side and in the supine position. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Physiological dead space (VD/VT) represents the
               fraction of ventilation not participating in gas exchange. In
               patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), VD/VT
               has prognostic value and can be used to guide ventilator
               settings. However, VD/VT is rarely calculated in clinical
               practice, because its measurement is perceived as challenging.
               Recently, a novel technique to calculate partial pressure of
               carbon dioxide in alveolar air (PACO2) using volumetric
               capnography (VCap) was validated. The purpose of the present
               study was to evaluate how VCap and other available techniques to
               measure PACO2 and partial pressure of carbon dioxide in mixed
               expired air (PeCO2) affect calculated VD/VT. METHODS: In a
               prospective, observational study, 15 post-cardiac surgery
               patients and 15 patients with ARDS were included. PACO2 was
               measured using VCap to calculate Bohr dead space or substituted
               with partial pressure of carbon dioxide in arterial blood
               (PaCO2) to calculate the Enghoff modification. PeCO2 was
               measured in expired air using three techniques: Douglas bag
               (DBag), indirect calorimetry (InCal), and VCap. Subsequently,
               VD/VT was calculated using four methods: Enghoff-DBag,
               Enghoff-InCal, Enghoff-VCap, and Bohr-VCap. RESULTS: PaCO2 was
               higher than PACO2, particularly in patients with ARDS
               (post-cardiac surgery PACO2 = 4.3 $\pm$ 0.6 kPa vs. PaCO2 = 5.2
               $\pm$ 0.5 kPa, P < 0.05; ARDS PACO2 = 3.9 $\pm$ 0.8 kPa vs.
               PaCO2 = 6.9 $\pm$ 1.7 kPa, P < 0.05). There was good agreement
               in PeCO2 calculated with DBag vs. VCap (post-cardiac surgery
               bias = 0.04 $\pm$ 0.19 kPa; ARDS bias = 0.03 $\pm$ 0.27 kPa) and
               relatively low agreement with DBag vs. InCal (post-cardiac
               surgery bias = -1.17 $\pm$ 0.50 kPa; ARDS mean bias = -0.15
               $\pm$ 0.53 kPa). These differences strongly affected calculated
               VD/VT. For example, in patients with ARDS, VD/VTcalculated with
               Enghoff-InCal was much higher than Bohr-VCap (VD/VT
               Enghoff-InCal = 66 $\pm$ 10 \% vs. VD/VT Bohr-VCap = 45 $\pm$ 7
               \%; P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Different techniques to measure
               PACO2 and PeCO2 result in clinically relevant mean and
               individual differences in calculated VD/VT, particularly in
               patients with ARDS. Volumetric capnography is a promising
               technique to calculate true Bohr dead space. Our results
               demonstrate the challenges clinicians face in interpreting an
               apparently simple measurement such as VD/VT.",

  abstract  = "PURPOSE OF REVIEW: In this review, we discuss the causes for a
               failed weaning trial and specific diagnostic tests that could be
               conducted to identify the cause for weaning failure. We briefly
               highlight treatment strategies that may enhance the chance of
               weaning success. RECENT FINDINGS: Impaired respiratory
               mechanics, respiratory muscle dysfunction, cardiac dysfunction,
               cognitive dysfunction, and metabolic disorders are recognized
               causes for weaning failure. In addition, iatrogenic factors may
               be at play. Most studies have focused on respiratory muscle
               dysfunction and cardiac dysfunction. Recent studies demonstrate
               that both ultrasound and electromyography are valuable tools to
               evaluate respiratory muscle function in ventilated patients.
               Sophisticated ultrasound techniques and biomarkers such as
               B-type natriuretic peptide, are valuable tools to identify
               cardiac dysfunction as a cause for weaning failure. Once a cause
               for weaning failure has been identified specific treatment
               should be instituted. Concerning treatment, both strength
               training and endurance training should be considered for
               patients with respiratory muscle weakness. Inotropes and
               vasodilators should be considered in case of heart failure.
               SUMMARY: Understanding the complex pathophysiology of weaning
               failure in combination with a systematic diagnostic approach
               allows identification of the primary cause of weaning failure.
               This will help the clinician to choose a specific treatment
               strategy and therefore may fasten liberation from mechanical
               ventilation.",

  abstract  = "INTRODUCTION: Systemic inflammation is a well-known risk factor
               for respiratory muscle weakness. Studies using animal models of
               inflammation have shown that endotoxin administration induces
               diaphragm dysfunction. However, the effects of in vivo endotoxin
               administration on diaphragm function in humans have not been
               studied. Our aim was to evaluate diaphragm function in a model
               of systemic inflammation in healthy subjects. METHODS: Two
               groups of 12 male volunteers received an intravenous bolus of 2
               ng/kg of Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and were
               monitored until 8 h after LPS administration. In the first
               group, the twitch transdiaphragmatic pressure (Pditw) and
               compound muscle action potential of the diaphragm (CMAPdi) were
               measured. In addition, plasma levels of cytokines, heart rate,
               and arterial blood pressure were measured. In the second group,
               catecholamines as well as respiratory rate and blood gas values
               were measured. Diaphragm ultrasonography was performed in four
               subjects with severe shivering. RESULTS: Lipopolysaccharide
               administration resulted in flulike symptoms, hemodynamic
               alterations, and increased plasma levels of cytokines. The Pditw
               increased after LPS administration from 31.2 $\pm$ 2.0 cmH2O
               (baseline) to 38.8 $\pm$ 2.0 cmH2O (t = 1 h) and 35.4 $\pm$ 2.0
               cmH2O (t = 1.5 h). There was no correlation between cytokine
               plasma levels and the Pditw. We found a trend toward a gradual
               decrease in the CMAPdi from 0.78 $\pm$ 0.07 mV (baseline) to
               0.58 $\pm$ 0.05 mV (t = 2 h). Respiratory rate increased after
               LPS administration from 16.8 $\pm$ 0.5 breaths/min (baseline) to
               20.3 $\pm$ 0.6 breaths/min (t = 4 h), with a resulting decrease
               in PaCO2 of 0.5 $\pm$ 0.1 kPa. Plasma levels of epinephrine
               peaked at t = 1.5 h, with an increase of 1.3 $\pm$ 0.3 nmol/L
               from baseline. Rapid diaphragm contractions consistent with
               shivering were observed. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that, in
               contrast to diaphragm dysfunction observed in animal models of
               inflammation, in vivo diaphragm contractility is augmented in
               the early phase after low-dose endotoxin administration in

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: In patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome
              (ARDS), the use of assisted mechanical ventilation is a subject
              of debate. Assisted ventilation has benefits over controlled
              ventilation, such as preserved diaphragm function and improved
              oxygenation. Therefore, higher level of ``patient control'' of
              ventilator assist may be preferable in ARDS. However, assisted
              modes may also increase the risk of high tidal volumes and
              lung-distending pressures. The current study aims to quantify how
              differences in freedom to control the ventilator affect
              lung-protective ventilation, breathing pattern variability, and
              patient-ventilator interaction. METHODS: Twelve patients with
              ARDS were ventilated in a randomized order with assist pressure
              control ventilation (PCV), pressure support ventilation (PSV),
              and neurally adjusted ventilatory assist (NAVA). Transpulmonary
              pressure, tidal volume, diaphragm electrical activity, and
              patient-ventilator interaction were measured. Respiratory
              variability was assessed using the coefficient of variation of
              tidal volume. RESULTS: During inspiration, transpulmonary
              pressure was slightly lower with NAVA (10.3 $\pm$ 0.7, 11.2 $\pm$
              0.7, and 9.4 $\pm$ 0.7 cm H2O for PCV, PSV, and NAVA,
              respectively; P < 0.01). Tidal volume was similar between modes
              (6.6 [5.7 to 7.0], 6.4 [5.8 to 7.0], and 6.0 [5.6 to 7.3] ml/kg
              for PCV, PSV, and NAVA, respectively), but respiratory
              variability was higher with NAVA (8.0 [6.4 to 10.0], 7.1 [5.9 to
              9.0], and 17.0 [12.0 to 36.1] \% for PCV, PSV, and NAVA,
              respectively; P < 0.001). Patient-ventilator interaction improved
              with NAVA (6 [5 to 8] \% error) compared with PCV (29 [14 to 52]
              \% error) and PSV (12 [9 to 27] \% error); P < 0.0001.
              CONCLUSION: In patients with mild-to-moderate ARDS, increasing
              freedom to control the ventilator maintains lung-protective
              ventilation in terms of tidal volume and lung-distending
              pressure, but it improves patient-ventilator interaction and
              preserves respiratory variability.",

               the field of respiratory muscle monitoring, in particular in
               critically ill patients. RECENT FINDINGS: Patients admitted to
               the ICU may develop severe respiratory muscle dysfunction in a
               very short time span. Among other factors, disuse and sepsis
               have been associated with respiratory muscle dysfunction in
               these patients. Because weakness is associated with adverse
               outcome, including prolonged mechanical ventilation and
               mortality, it is surprising that respiratory muscle dysfunction
               largely develops without being noticed by the clinician.
               Respiratory muscle monitoring is not standard of care in most
               ICUs. Improvements in technology have opened windows for
               monitoring the respiratory muscles in critically ill patients.
               Diaphragm electromyography and esophageal pressure measurement
               are feasible techniques for respiratory muscle monitoring,
               although the effect on outcome remains to be investigated.
               SUMMARY: Respiratory muscle dysfunction develops rapidly in
               selected critically ill patients and is associated with adverse
               outcome. Recent technological advances allow real-time
               monitoring of respiratory muscle activity in these patients.
               Although this field is in its infancy, from a physiological
               perspective, it is reasonable to assume that monitoring
               respiratory muscle activity improves outcome in these patients.",

               ventilation (NIV) is challenging with flow- or
               pressure-controlled ventilators, especially in patients with
               chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Neurally adjusted
               ventilatory assist (NAVA) uses diaphragm electrical activity
               (EAdi) to control the ventilator. We evaluated
               patient-ventilator interaction in patients with COPD during NIV
               with pressure support ventilation (PSV) and NAVA using a
               recently introduced automated analysis. METHODS: Twelve COPD
               patients underwent three 30-minute trials: 1) PSV with dedicated
               NIV ventilator (NIV-PSVVision), 2) PSV with intensive care unit
               (ICU) ventilator (NIV-PSVServo-I), and 3) with NIV-NAVA. EAdi,
               flow, and airway pressure were recorded. Patient-ventilator
               interaction was evaluated by comparing airway pressure and EAdi
               waveforms with automated computer algorithms. The NeuroSync
               index was calculated as the percentage of timing errors between
               airway pressure and EAdi. RESULTS: The NeuroSync index was
               higher (larger error) for NIV-PSVVision (24 (IQR 15 to 30) \%)
               and NIV-PSVServo-I (21 (IQR 15 to 26) \%) compared to NIV-NAVA
               (5 (IQR 4 to 7) \%; P <0.001). Wasted efforts, trigger delays
               and cycling-off errors were less with NAVA (P <0.05 for all).
               The NeuroSync index and the number of wasted efforts were
               strongly correlated (r2 = 0.84), with a drastic increase in
               wasted efforts after timing errors reach 20\%. CONCLUSIONS: In
               COPD patients, non-invasive NAVA improves patient-ventilator
               interaction compared to PSV, delivered either by a dedicated or
               ICU ventilator. The automated analysis of patient-ventilator
               interaction allowed for an objective detection of
               patient-ventilator interaction during NIV. In addition, we found

               increased over the last years in patients with acute respiratory
               failure. However, failure rates for NIV remain high in specific
               patient categories. Several studies have identified factors that
               contribute to NIV failure, including low experience of the
               medical team and patient-ventilator asynchrony. An important
               difference between invasive ventilation and NIV is the role of
               the upper airway. During invasive ventilation the endotracheal
               tube bypasses the upper airway, but during NIV upper airway
               patency may play a role in the successful application of NIV. In
               response to positive pressure, upper airway patency may decrease
               and therefore impair minute ventilation. This paper aims to
               discuss the effect of positive pressure ventilation on upper
               airway patency and its possible clinical implications, and to
               stimulate research in this field.",

               highly appropriate to monitor the respiratory muscles in these

               monitoring respiratory muscle function. Indeed, most clinicians
               do not evaluate respiratory muscle function in critically ill
               patients at all. In our opinion, however, practical issues and
               the absence of sound scientific data for clinical benefit should
               not discourage clinicians from having a closer look at
               respiratory muscle function in critically ill patients. This
               perspective discusses the latest developments in the field of
               respiratory muscle monitoring and possible implications of

  abstract  = "RATIONALE: Acquired diaphragm muscle weakness is a key feature
               in several chronic conditions, including chronic obstructive
               pulmonary disease, congestive heart failure, and difficult
               weaning from mechanical ventilation. No drugs are available to
               improve respiratory muscle function in these patients. Recently,
               we have shown that the calcium sensitizer levosimendan enhances
               the force-generating capacity of isolated diaphragm fibers.
               OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effects of the calcium sensitizer
               levosimendan on in vivo human diaphragm function. METHODS: In a
               double-blind, randomized, crossover design, 30 healthy subjects
               performed two identical inspiratory loading tasks. After the
               first loading task, subjects received levosimendan (40 $\mu$g/kg
               bolus followed by 0.1/0.2 $\mu$g/kg/min continuous infusion) or
               placebo. Transdiaphragmatic pressure, diaphragm electrical
               activity, and their relationship (neuromechanical efficiency)
               were measured during loading. Magnetic phrenic nerve stimulation
               was performed before the first loading task and after bolus
               administration to assess twitch contractility. Center frequency
               of diaphragm electrical activity was evaluated to study the
               effects of levosimendan on muscle fiber conduction velocity.
               MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The placebo group showed a 9\%
               (P=0.01) loss of twitch contractility after loaded breathing,
               whereas no loss in contractility was observed in the
               levosimendan group. Neuro-mechanical efficiency of the diaphragm
               during loading improved by 21\% (P<0.05) in the levosimendan
               group. Baseline center frequency of diaphragm electrical
               activity was reduced after levosimendan administration (P<0.05).
               CONCLUSIONS: The calcium sensitizer levosimendan improves
               neuromechanical efficiency and contractile function of the human
               diaphragm. Our findings suggest a new therapeutic approach to
               improve respiratory muscle function in patients with respiratory
               failure.",
